\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}
\end{algorithm}

Byzantine agreement is possible if $n > 3f$ using a protocol with $f+1$ rounds.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{CAP Theorem}

\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

For unconstrained convex optimization:

$E' \leftarrow E$\;
\While{$E' \neq \emptyset$}{
    Pick arbitrary edge $(u,v) \in E'$\;
    $C \leftarrow C \cup \{u,v\}$\;
    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{theorem}[Vertex Cover Approximation]
The greedy algorithm produces a vertex cover of size at most $2 \cdot OPT$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Linear Programming Relaxation}

\begin{definition}[Voronoi Cell]
For point set $P = \{p_1, ..., p_n\}$, the Voronoi cell of $p_i$ is:
$$V(p_i) = \{x : d(x, p_i) \leq d(x, p_j) \text{ for all } j \neq i\}$$
\end{definition}

    }
}
\caption{Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm searches an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time.

The algorithm uses amplitude amplification to increase the probability of measuring the target state through repeated application of the Grover operator:
$$G = -U_s U_f$$

where $U_f$ flips the amplitude of the target state and $U_s$ reflects about the average amplitude.

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }

\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

        }
    }
}

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}

\Return{optimal solution}\;
\caption{Simplex Algorithm}

The central path is parameterized by $\mu > 0$:
$$x(\mu) = \arg\min \{c^T x - \mu \sum_{i=1}^n \ln x_i : Ax = b, x > 0\}$$

\section{Convex Optimization}

$$f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \leq \theta f(x) + (1-\theta)f(y)$$
\end{definition}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

\item For item $i$, increment counters at positions $(j, h_j(i))$ for $j = 1, ..., d$

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined

\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]

\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{

        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y

A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes

\section{Hash Tables}

$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

$$x(\mu) = \arg\min \{c^T x - \mu \sum_{i=1}^n \ln x_i : Ax = b, x > 0\}$$

\section{Convex Optimization}

$$f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \leq \theta f(x) + (1-\theta)f(y)$$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

$$x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - \alpha_k \nabla f(x^{(k)})$$

\begin{theorem}[Gradient Descent Convergence]

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

\Return{optimal solution}\;
\caption{Simplex Algorithm}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

\item For item $i$, increment counters at positions $(j, h_j(i))$ for $j = 1, ..., d$

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}

\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

$$f_i \leq \hat{f_i} \leq f_i + \frac{2||f||_1}{w}$$
where $d = \lceil \ln(1/\delta) \rceil$ and $w = \lceil 2/\epsilon \rceil$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Online Algorithms}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}

After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }

\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{

        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

$$f(\theta x + (1-\theta)y) \leq \theta f(x) + (1-\theta)f(y)$$
\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

\Return{optimal solution}\;
\caption{Simplex Algorithm}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

\end{enumerate}

\section{Streaming Algorithms}

Streaming algorithms process data in a single pass using sublinear space.

\item Use $d$ hash functions mapping to $[1, w]$
\item Maintain $d \times w$ counter matrix
\item For item $i$, increment counters at positions $(j, h_j(i))$ for $j = 1, ..., d$
\item Estimate frequency as $\min_j C[j, h_j(i)]$
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;

where $U_f$ flips the amplitude of the target state and $U_s$ reflects about the average amplitude.

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;

\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}
\end{algorithm}

\end{definition}

\subsection{Gradient Descent}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}

After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{

        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y

A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}
\Return{NULL}\;
\caption{Skip List Search}

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;

\chapter{Introduction to Computational Complexity}

The study of computational complexity theory represents one of the most fundamental areas of theoretical computer science, encompassing the analysis of computational resources required to solve problems algorithmically. This comprehensive treatise examines the mathematical foundations underlying complexity classes, algorithmic paradigms, and their practical applications in modern distributed computing environments.

\section{Mathematical Foundations}

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the class of decision problems solvable in polynomial time, and let $\mathcal{NP}$ represent the class of problems verifiable in polynomial time. The central question of whether $\mathcal{P} = \mathcal{NP}$ remains one of the most significant open problems in mathematics and computer science.

\begin{definition}[Polynomial Time]
A problem $\Pi$ is said to be in $\mathcal{P}$ if there exists a deterministic Turing machine $M$ and a polynomial $p(n)$ such that for all inputs $x$ of length $n$, machine $M$ decides $\Pi(x)$ in at most $p(n)$ steps.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin Theorem]
The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is $\mathcal{NP}$-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in two parts: showing that SAT is in $\mathcal{NP}$, and demonstrating that every problem in $\mathcal{NP}$ reduces to SAT in polynomial time.

First, we establish that SAT $\in \mathcal{NP}$. Given a Boolean formula $\phi$ and a truth assignment $\tau$, we can verify in polynomial time whether $\tau$ satisfies $\phi$ by evaluating each clause.

For the second part, consider any problem $L \in \mathcal{NP}$. By definition, there exists a polynomial-time verifiable relation $R_L$ such that:
$$x \in L \iff \exists y \text{ such that } |y| \leq p(|x|) \text{ and } R_L(x,y) = 1$$

We construct a polynomial-time reduction from $L$ to SAT by transforming the computation of the verifier for $R_L$ into a Boolean formula.
\end{proof}

\section{Algorithmic Paradigms}

The landscape of algorithmic design encompasses several fundamental paradigms, each with distinct characteristics and applications:

\subsection{Divide and Conquer}

The divide-and-conquer paradigm follows a recursive structure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Divide}: Break the problem into smaller subproblems
\item \textbf{Conquer}: Solve subproblems recursively
\item \textbf{Combine}: Merge solutions to obtain the final result
\end{enumerate}

A canonical example is the merge sort algorithm with time complexity $T(n) = 2T(n/2) + \Theta(n)$, yielding $T(n) = \Theta(n \log n)$ by the Master Theorem.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Array $A[1..n]$}
\KwResult{Sorted array $A[1..n]$}
\If{$n > 1$}{
    $mid \leftarrow \lfloor n/2 \rfloor$\;
    $MergeSort(A[1..mid])$\;
    $MergeSort(A[mid+1..n])$\;
    $Merge(A, 1, mid, n)$\;
}
\caption{Merge Sort Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Dynamic Programming}

Dynamic programming optimizes recursive algorithms by storing solutions to overlapping subproblems. The technique applies when problems exhibit:
\begin{itemize}
\item Optimal substructure
\item Overlapping subproblems
\end{itemize}

Consider the classic longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. For strings $X = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $Y = y_1y_2...y_n$, we define:

$$LCS[i,j] = \begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \\
LCS[i-1,j-1] + 1 & \text{if } x_i = y_j \\
\max(LCS[i-1,j], LCS[i,j-1]) & \text{if } x_i \neq y_j
\end{cases}$$

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step, hoping to find a global optimum. While not always correct, they provide efficient solutions for many optimization problems.

\begin{theorem}[Greedy Choice Property]
An algorithm has the greedy choice property if a globally optimal solution can be arrived at by making a locally optimal choice.
\end{theorem}

The fractional knapsack problem exemplifies successful greedy application:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sort items by value-to-weight ratio in descending order
\item Take items in order until knapsack is full
\item Take fraction of next item if necessary
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Graph Theory and Network Algorithms}

Graph theory provides the mathematical foundation for modeling relationships and connections in computational systems. This chapter explores fundamental graph algorithms and their applications to network optimization.

\section{Graph Representations}

Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Common representations include:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}
An $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A[i,j] = 1$ if $(v_i, v_j) \in E$, and $A[i,j] = 0$ otherwise.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V|^2)$
Edge query time: $\Theta(1)$

\subsection{Adjacency List}
An array of lists where each vertex $v$ has a list containing its neighbors.

Space complexity: $\Theta(|V| + |E|)$
Edge query time: $O(degree(v))$

\section{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

For non-negative edge weights, Dijkstra's algorithm computes single-source shortest paths in $O(|V|^2)$ time with arrays, or $O((|V| + |E|) \log |V|)$ with binary heaps.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Graph $G = (V,E)$, source vertex $s$}
\KwResult{Shortest distances $d[v]$ for all $v \in V$}
Initialize $d[s] = 0$, $d[v] = \infty$ for $v \neq s$\;
$Q \leftarrow V$\;
\While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
    $u \leftarrow \arg\min_{v \in Q} d[v]$\;
    $Q \leftarrow Q \setminus \{u\}$\;
    \ForEach{vertex $v$ adjacent to $u$}{
        \If{$d[u] + w(u,v) < d[v]$}{
            $d[v] \leftarrow d[u] + w(u,v)$\;
        }
    }
}
\caption{Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

The Bellman-Ford algorithm handles negative edge weights and detects negative cycles in $O(|V||E|)$ time.

\begin{theorem}[Bellman-Ford Correctness]
After $k$ iterations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm, $d[v]$ contains the shortest path distance from the source to $v$ using at most $k$ edges.
\end{theorem}

\section{Network Flows}

Maximum flow problems model resource allocation and transportation optimization. The Ford-Fulkerson method provides a framework for computing maximum flows.

\begin{definition}[Flow Network]
A flow network is a directed graph $G = (V,E)$ with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Source vertex $s \in V$
\item Sink vertex $t \in V$  
\item Capacity function $c: E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem]
In any flow network, the value of a maximum flow equals the capacity of a minimum cut.
\end{theorem}

The Edmonds-Karp algorithm implements Ford-Fulkerson using BFS to find augmenting paths, achieving $O(|V||E|^2)$ time complexity.

\chapter{Advanced Data Structures}

Efficient data structures form the backbone of algorithmic design, enabling optimal time and space complexity for fundamental operations.

\section{Balanced Binary Search Trees}

\subsection{AVL Trees}

AVL trees maintain balance through rotation operations, ensuring $O(\log n)$ height and operation complexity.

\begin{definition}[AVL Property]
For every node $v$ in an AVL tree, the heights of the left and right subtrees of $v$ differ by at most 1.
\end{definition}

Rotation operations preserve the BST property while restoring balance:

\textbf{Right Rotation:}
\begin{verbatim}
    y              x
   / \            / \
  x   C   ==>    A   y
 / \                / \
A   B              B   C
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Red-Black Trees}

Red-black trees use node coloring to maintain approximate balance:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every node is either red or black
\item The root is black
\item All leaves (NIL) are black
\item Red nodes have black children
\item Every path from a node to descendant leaves contains the same number of black nodes
\end{enumerate}

\section{Hash Tables}

Hash tables provide average-case $O(1)$ insertion, deletion, and lookup through careful design of hash functions and collision resolution.

\subsection{Universal Hashing}

A family $\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions is universal if for any distinct keys $x, y$:
$$\Pr_{h \in \mathcal{H}}[h(x) = h(y)] \leq \frac{1}{m}$$

where $m$ is the table size.

\begin{theorem}[Universal Hashing Performance]
Using universal hashing with chaining, the expected time for operations is $O(1 + \alpha)$ where $\alpha = n/m$ is the load factor.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Perfect Hashing}

For static sets, perfect hashing achieves worst-case $O(1)$ lookup time using a two-level hashing scheme.

\chapter{Randomized Algorithms}

Randomization introduces a powerful tool for algorithm design, often simplifying complex problems and improving average-case performance.

\section{Probabilistic Analysis}

\subsection{Las Vegas vs Monte Carlo}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Las Vegas}: Always correct, random running time
\item \textbf{Monte Carlo}: Fixed running time, probabilistically correct
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Randomized QuickSort}

Randomized pivot selection ensures expected $O(n \log n)$ performance regardless of input distribution.

\begin{theorem}[QuickSort Expected Complexity]
The expected number of comparisons made by randomized QuickSort on $n$ elements is $2n \ln n + O(n)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $X_{ij}$ be the indicator random variable for whether elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared (where $z_1 < z_2 < ... < z_n$ are the sorted elements).

The total number of comparisons is:
$$X = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} X_{ij}$$

By linearity of expectation:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} E[X_{ij}] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \Pr[X_{ij} = 1]$$

Elements $z_i$ and $z_j$ are compared if and only if one of them is chosen as a pivot before any element $z_k$ with $i < k < j$. Since all elements in $\{z_i, z_{i+1}, ..., z_j\}$ are equally likely to be chosen first:

$$\Pr[X_{ij} = 1] = \frac{2}{j - i + 1}$$

Therefore:
$$E[X] = \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \frac{2}{j - i + 1} = 2\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \sum_{k=2}^{n-i+1} \frac{1}{k} \leq 2n \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k} = 2n H_n = 2n \ln n + O(n)$$
\end{proof}

\section{Randomized Data Structures}

\subsection{Skip Lists}

Skip lists provide a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees with expected $O(\log n)$ operations.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Key $k$ to search}
\KwResult{Node containing $k$ or NULL}
$x \leftarrow header$\;
\ForEach{level $i$ from $maxLevel$ down to $0$}{
    \While{$x.forward[i].key < k$}{
        $x \leftarrow x.forward[i]$\;
    }
}
$x \leftarrow x.forward[0]$\;
\If{$x.key = k$}{
    \Return{$x$}\;
}

    Remove all edges incident to $u$ or $v$ from $E'$\;
}
\Return{$C$}\;
\caption{Greedy Vertex Cover}

String processing algorithms are fundamental to text analysis, bioinformatics, and data compression.

\section{String Matching}

\subsection{Knuth-Morris-Pratt Algorithm}

KMP achieves linear-time string matching through preprocessing:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Text $T[1..n]$, pattern $P[1..m]$}
\KwResult{All occurrences of $P$ in $T$}
Compute failure function $\pi$ for $P$\;
$q \leftarrow 0$\;
\ForEach{$i = 1$ to $n$}{
    \While{$q > 0$ and $P[q+1] \neq T[i]$}{
        $q \leftarrow \pi[q]$\;
    }
    \If{$P[q+1] = T[i]$}{
        $q \leftarrow q + 1$\;
    }
    \If{$q = m$}{
        Print "Pattern occurs at position" $i - m + 1$\;
        $q \leftarrow \pi[q]$\;
    }
}
\caption{Knuth-Morris-Pratt String Matching}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Suffix Arrays}

Suffix arrays provide a space-efficient alternative to suffix trees for many string problems.

\begin{definition}[Suffix Array]
For string $S[1..n]$, the suffix array $SA[1..n]$ is a permutation of $\{1, 2, ..., n\}$ such that:
$$S[SA[1]..n] < S[SA[2]..n] < ... < S[SA[n]..n]$$
\end{definition}

DC3 algorithm constructs suffix arrays in linear time.

\section{Data Compression}

\subsection{Huffman Coding}

Huffman coding achieves optimal prefix-free encoding:

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\SetAlgoLined
\KwData{Character frequencies}
\KwResult{Huffman tree}
Create leaf node for each character\;
Build min-heap $Q$ of all leaf nodes\;
\While{$|Q| > 1$}{
    $x \leftarrow$ extract-min from $Q$\;
    $y \leftarrow$ extract-min from $Q$\;
    Create new internal node $z$ with children $x, y$\;
    Set frequency of $z$ to frequency of $x$ plus frequency of $y$\;
    Insert $z$ into $Q$\;
}
\Return{remaining node in $Q$}\;
\caption{Huffman Coding Algorithm}

\chapter{Advanced Topics}

This chapter explores cutting-edge algorithmic techniques and their applications to emerging computational challenges.

\section{Quantum Algorithms}

Quantum computing leverages quantum mechanical phenomena to solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

\subsection{Grover's Algorithm}

Grover's algorithm searches an unsorted database of $N$ items in $O(\sqrt{N})$ time.

The algorithm uses amplitude amplification to increase the probability of measuring the target state through repeated application of the Grover operator:
$$G = -U_s U_f$$

where $U_f$ flips the amplitude of the target state and $U_s$ reflects about the average amplitude.

\subsection{Shor's Algorithm}

Shor's algorithm factors integers in polynomial time using quantum period finding:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose random $a < N$
\item Use quantum period finding to find period $r$ of $f(x) = a^x \bmod N$
\item If $r$ is even and $a^{r/2} \not\equiv -1 \pmod{N}$, compute $\gcd(a^{r/2} \pm 1, N)$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Streaming Algorithms}

Streaming algorithms process data in a single pass using sublinear space.

\subsection{Count-Min Sketch}

Count-Min sketch estimates item frequencies in data streams:

\begin{itemize}
\item Use $d$ hash functions mapping to $[1, w]$
\item Maintain $d \times w$ counter matrix
\item For item $i$, increment counters at positions $(j, h_j(i))$ for $j = 1, ..., d$
\item Estimate frequency as $\min_j C[j, h_j(i)]$
\end{itemize}

\begin{theorem}[Count-Min Sketch Guarantee]
With probability $1 - \delta$, the estimate $\hat{f_i}$ satisfies:
$$f_i \leq \hat{f_i} \leq f_i + \frac{2||f||_1}{w}$$
where $d = \lceil \ln(1/\delta) \rceil$ and $w = \lceil 2/\epsilon \rceil$.
\end{theorem}

\section{Online Algorithms}

Online algorithms make decisions without knowledge of future inputs.

\subsection{Competitive Analysis}

An online algorithm $A$ is $c$-competitive if for all input sequences $\sigma$:
$$A(\sigma) \leq c \cdot OPT(\sigma) + \alpha$$

where $OPT(\sigma)$ is the optimal offline cost and $\alpha$ is a constant.

\subsection{Paging Algorithm}

The Longest Recently Used (LRU) paging algorithm is $k$-competitive for cache size $k$.

\begin{theorem}[LRU Competitiveness]
LRU is $k$-competitive for the paging problem with cache size $k$.
\end{theorem}
