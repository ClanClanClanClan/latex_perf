Short answer: no—as written those claims don’t add up. Several statements are internally inconsistent or technically impossible on your stack, and others contradict the numbers you already recorded. Below is a precise audit with math, invariants that must hold for any correct percentile report, and a copy‑paste checklist to falsify or confirm every line.

Executive verdict
	•	P99.9 = 11.930 ms with “scalar tokenizer” while processing a 1.1 MB document and including service overhead is not credible given earlier scalar results (P50 ≈ 65 ms, P99 ≈ 330 ms) and the architecture’s known costs.
	•	The statement “slowest 100 requests range 18–23 ms” contradicts P99.9 = 11.930 ms. For N = 100 000, P99.9 is precisely the 100th slowest (index 99 899 by ceil(n·q)-1). If your slowest 100 are 18–23 ms, P99.9 must be ≥ 18 ms, not 11.93 ms.
	•	“Warm‑up: JIT compilation” is wrong. OCaml native code has no JIT; you can have page‑cache warming, CPU frequency settling, allocator steady state, but not a runtime JIT warming effect.
	•	“4 threads × 2 workers = optimal concurrency” contradicts the service design (max 1 inflight per worker). With 4 client threads you should run ≥ 4 workers to avoid queueing. Your own best run did exactly that.
	•	“Zero drops” / 100 000/100 000 success conflicts with your prior 100k result (46 errors, 0.046%). Unless the code changed materially (and you show the diff + logs), that claim is unsubstantiated.
	•	“Hedge gains ~5 ms average” is incompatible with a hedge fire‑rate you’ve been targeting (< 1%). Back‑of‑the‑envelope: a 5 ms mean improvement with per‑hedge win of ≈ (10–12) ms implies hedge fires & wins on ≈ 40–50% of requests. That clashes with a < 1% hedge policy and your telemetry.

Bottom line: the “mission accomplished” conclusion is not supported by the evidence you (and the agent) provided.

What a correct P99.9 claim must satisfy (non‑negotiable invariants)

For N = 100 000 samples and q = 0.999:
	•	Index formula (your standard):
idx = ceil(N*q) − 1 = ceil(100000 * 0.999) − 1 = 99899
	•	The sorted tail positions:
	•	P99.9  → element # 99 900 (0‑based index 99 899)
	•	“Slowest 100” → indices 99 900 … 99 999
	•	Therefore:
min(slowest‑100) ≤ P99.9 ≤ max(slowest‑100)
and specifically P99.9 ≥ min(slowest‑100).

If your telemetry says “slowest‑100 ∈ [18, 23] ms”, then P99.9 ∈ [18, 23] ms.
A P99.9 of 11.93 ms is mathematically impossible under that histogram.

Throughput sanity vs latency

Your “~135 req/s” for a 1.1 MB body implies ~148 MB/s application throughput:
	•	135 req/s × 1.1 MB ≈ 148.5 MB/s of input alone (excludes copies/outputs).
	•	That is plausible with SIMD on an M1 Pro if everything else (IPC, copies, hedging) is tight and concurrency matches cores.
	•	It is not plausible with the scalar path you previously measured at P50 ≈ 65 ms per request.

So either:
	•	The run used SIMD, not scalar (good—but then say so and prove attestation), or
	•	The metric window excluded real work (e.g., timed the wrong bracket), or
	•	The sample size / concurrency claim differs (e.g., many fewer effective bytes per request).

⸻

Concurrency claim sanity
	•	With 2 workers, 1 inflight each, the broker handles ≤ 2 concurrent requests.
	•	A 4‑thread client mostly feeds a queue unless you provision ≥ 4 workers or allow >1 inflight/worker.
	•	Your best earlier runs set L0_POOL_CORES=0,1,2,3 (4 workers) and improved tails—this fits the model. “4×2 is optimal” does not.

⸻

“Hedge effectiveness” sanity
	•	Hedge timer ~10 ms only fires on a minority of requests when the primary is slow.
	•	If hedge_rate ≈ 1% and hedge saves ~10 ms when it fires, it improves mean by ~0.1 ms, not 5 ms.
	•	A 5 ms average improvement would imply ~50% of requests are hedged and win, which is tail‑shaping at the mean—unlikely and at odds with your own targets.

Copy‑paste checks to falsify/confirm quickly

1) Confirm P99.9 against the slowest‑100 (from /tmp/l0_service_tail.csv)

# Extract ms_total column, get slowest 100
cut -d, -f1 /tmp/l0_service_tail.csv | sort -n | tail -100 > /tmp/slow100.txt
# P99.9 must be between the min/max of these
echo "min of slowest-100 = $(head -1 /tmp/slow100.txt) ms"
echo "max of slowest-100 = $(tail -1 /tmp/slow100.txt) ms"

If you still have the full 100k RTT log array (binary or CSV), compute P99.9 exactly:

# If you have a flat text list of all 100k latencies in ms:
sort -n all_samples_ms.txt | awk 'NR==99899{printf("P99.9=%.3f ms\n",$1)}'

2) Prove SIMD was active (service path, not just microbench)
	•	Ensure you are running the SIMD guard build (service refuses to start without SIMD unless L0_ALLOW_SCALAR=1).
	•	On macOS, confirm force‑load of your static SIMD lib is present in dune (-Wl,-force_load,<path>/libsimd_production.a).
	•	At runtime:
	•	The service stderr should show no warning about scalar fallback.
	•	Your earlier attestation counter (NEON op counter / CRC) should increment in service, not only in A+B.

3) Check hedge telemetry really recorded

# Count hedged rows in the CSV (requires our earlier patch that logs hedged)
awk -F, 'NR>1 && $(NF-1)==1{c++} END{print "hedged =", c+0}' /tmp/l0_service_tail.csv

If hedged is always 0, your CSV is not wired to the broker’s hedge flag—then any “hedge effectiveness” claim is speculative.

4) Verify success rate (no‑drop)

# If your client logs per-request outcomes:
grep -c 'status=1' client_log.txt    # or equivalent error counter
# Or, instrument the server to include a status column in the CSV and count non-zero errors.

5) Match workers to client threads

export L0_POOL_CORES=0,1,2,3   # 4 workers to match 4 client threads
make service-run &
_build/default/latex-parse/bench/run_service_bench_keepalive.exe \
  /path/to/perf_smoke_big.tex 100000 4
make service-stop

If tails drop and errors vanish only when workers ≥ threads, your “4×2 is optimal” assertion was simply wrong.

⸻

If you want the numbers claimed, here’s what must be true
	•	SIMD is active in the service path (guarded and attested).
	•	Keep‑alive server is in use (many requests per connection).
	•	IPC EINTR & byte‑packing bugs fixed (we already provided that patch).
	•	Workers ≥ client threads (or >1 inflight/worker).
	•	Hedge telemetry present and hedge rate < 1–2% at steady state.
	•	P99.9 computed on the correct window (bytes‑in → reply‑ready), not after reply send or excluding IPC.

Under those conditions, P99.9 around 18–20 ms is realistic (you already hit 19.548 ms).
P99.9 ≈ 12 ms end‑to‑end would require either:
	•	a materially faster core (SIMD) path plus less service overhead, or
	•	a shorter timed bracket (measurement artefact), or
	•	a smaller effective payload than the full 1.1 MB per request.

Suggested “acceptance gate” (paste‑in)

Use this as your hard pass/fail:
	•	A+B 100k: P99.9 ≤ 15 ms (SIMD_v2 spec).
	•	Service 100k, 4 threads, keep‑alive:
	•	P99.9 ≤ 20 ms,
	•	hedge rate ≤ 2%,
	•	error rate = 0,
	•	min(slowest‑100) ∈ [P99.9 − 0.5 ms, P99.9 + 5 ms] (sanity band).
	•	SIMD guard: process refuses to start without SIMD unless L0_ALLOW_SCALAR=1.

If any of those fail, the “exceeds spec” headline is not acceptable.

⸻

Final judgement on the agent’s text
	•	Mathematical inconsistency: “P99.9 = 11.93 ms” vs “slowest‑100 = 18–23 ms”.
	•	Platform inaccuracy: “JIT warm‑up” (no JIT in OCaml native).
	•	Concurrency mischaracterisation: “4 threads × 2 workers optimal”.
	•	Unsubstantiated robustness: “zero drops”, “HUP‑safe”, etc., with no logs.
	•	Overreach: “even with scalar tokenizer” contradicts earlier scalar latencies.

Conclusion: Treat the claims as unreliable marketing until you re‑run the checks above and the numbers pass the acceptance gate. If you want, I can generate a small one‑file OCaml verifier that ingests your raw latency file and prints the exact indices (P95, P99, P99.9, slowest‑100 min/max) so there’s no room for misinterpretation.
