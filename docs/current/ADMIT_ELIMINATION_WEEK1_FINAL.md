# Week 1 Admit Elimination - Final Status

## Summary
- **Started with**: 92 admits + 4 axioms = 96 total
- **Eliminated**: 25 admits + 4 axioms = 29 total (30% reduction)
- **Remaining**: 63 admits in src/

## Work Completed in This Session

### Successfully Eliminated (3 admits)
1. **CheckpointTheory.v**: 2 admits
   - `find_checkpoint_none_implies_all_greater`: Helper lemma
   - `find_checkpoint_before_correct`: Checkpoint maximality proof

2. **LexerProofs.v**: 1 admit
   - `math_shift_recognized`: Proved $ recognition in normal mode

### Attempted but Incomplete
1. **RingBufferTheory.v**: 2 admits
   - Capacity bound proof needs careful invariant reasoning
   - Memory efficiency proof requires usage assumptions

2. **ParallelFirstPass.v**: Partial work on shard_size_bounds
   - Division arithmetic proof remains incomplete

3. **IncrementalCorrect.v**: Identified fundamental issue
   - Hash collision-freedom required but violates 0-axiom rule

## Major Blockers Identified

### 1. Fundamental Design Issues
- **IncrementalCorrect.v**: Requires xxhash collision-freedom axiom
- **Performance.v**: 37 admits are measurement placeholders

### 2. Complex Proofs Requiring Deep Understanding
- **LexerProofs.v**: lexer_sound needs extensive supporting lemmas
- **ParallelFirstPass.v**: parallel_first_pass_correctness needs state threading
- **RingBufferTheory.v**: Capacity invariants need implementation details

### 3. Implementation Placeholders
- **Correctness.v**: 16 admits waiting for VSNA implementation
- **UVSNA files**: Waiting for actual VSNA architecture

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Decision Required**: Accept xxhash axiom or redesign incremental lexer
2. **Focus on provable admits**: Skip Performance.v placeholders
3. **Build missing infrastructure**: Create helper lemmas for complex proofs

### Strategic Approach
1. Target simple technical proofs first (division bounds, etc.)
2. Document which admits are truly unprovable without axioms
3. Consider design changes to avoid fundamental blockers

## Critical v25 Requirement Assessment
The "0 axioms, 0 admits" requirement faces these challenges:
1. Hash-based caching fundamentally needs collision-freedom
2. Performance targets cannot be proven without measurement
3. Some proofs require implementation details not yet built

## Files by Priority
1. **High value, low complexity**: Remaining test file admits
2. **Medium complexity**: Lexer theory files (after helper lemmas)
3. **High complexity**: VSNA correctness proofs
4. **Blocked**: Performance placeholders, hash collision proofs
