## CLARIFICATION SUMMARY

The comprehensive Spec-Clarification Pack provided complete resolution to all uncertainties documented in `COMPLETE_PROJECT_UNCERTAINTIES.md`. This document shows how each major uncertainty category was resolved and integrated into the permanent documentation structure.

---

## I. ARCHITECTURAL CONFUSION → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: Dual Layer System Confusion
**Uncertainty**: Two different layer systems found - VSNA layers vs Validation layers

**Clarification Provided**: 
- VSNA Layers (L0-L4): Sequential processing pipeline that transforms documents
- Validation Layers (V1-V4): Orthogonal rule engines that consume VSNA outputs  
- They operate independently but synchronously

**Integration**: Fully documented in `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section I

### Original Problem: Layer-02 Terminology
**Uncertainty**: What is "Layer-02" - expander or parser?

**Clarification Provided**: 
- "Layer-02" in roadmap = L1 Expander (not L2 Parser)
- Roadmap numbering is off-by-one from internal VSNA numbering
- L1 = Layer-02 in external documentation

**Integration**: Documented in `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section VII (Critical Disambiguations)

---

## II. INTERFACE SPECIFICATIONS → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: L1 Interface Ambiguity  
**Uncertainty**: Tuple vs curried interface, token type source, proof specifications

**Clarification Provided**:
- Interface: `expand : exp_state -> list latex_token -> expand_result`
- Token type: Import from `LatexLexer.v` (canonical 13-token system)
- Exact proof targets with complete theorem statements

**Integration**: Fully specified in `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md` Section II

### Original Problem: Built-in Macro Scope
**Uncertainty**: Just `\LaTeX`, `\TeX` or full `\newcommand` support?

**Clarification Provided**:
- 76 specific built-in macros cataloged completely
- Basic `\newcommand` support with LaTeX ε constraints
- No optional arguments, no recursion allowed

**Integration**: Complete catalog in `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md` Section III

---

## III. PROOF REQUIREMENTS → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: Vague Proof Targets
**Uncertainty**: "expand_fuel_insensitive" - exact theorem statement unclear

**Clarification Provided**: Complete theorem statements with proofs strategies:

```coq
Theorem expand_fuel_insensitive : forall st tokens fuel1 fuel2 result,
  fuel1 >= required_fuel st tokens ->
  fuel2 >= required_fuel st tokens ->
  expand_with_fuel fuel1 st tokens = Some result ->
  expand_with_fuel fuel2 st tokens = Some result.

Theorem expand_terminates_acyclic : forall st tokens,
  acyclic_macros st ->
  valid_latex_epsilon tokens ->
  exists result, expand st tokens = result /\ result <> ExpandError (RecursionLimit _).

Theorem expand_no_teof : forall st tokens result,
  expand st tokens = ExpandSuccess result ->
  ~ In TEOF tokens ->
  ~ In TEOF result.
```

**Integration**: Fully specified in `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md` Section IV and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Step 6

## IV. PROJECT SCOPE → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: Project Identity Crisis
**Uncertainty**: "What IS LaTeX Perfectionist v24?"

**Clarification Provided**:
- Complete formally verified LaTeX processing pipeline with 542 validation rules
- VSNA architecture with dual-track implementation (Coq + OCaml)
- L0 Lexer is foundation, not the final product
- Full pipeline: Lexer → Expander → Parser → Interpreter → Stylesheet

**Integration**: Executive summary in `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` and complete project description in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`

### Original Problem: Rule System Architecture
**Uncertainty**: How do 542 rules relate to processing layers?

**Clarification Provided**:
- V1: 150+ token-level rules (operate on L0 output)
- V1½: 50+ post-expansion rules (operate on L1 output)  
- V2: 200+ structural rules (operate on L2 output)
- V3: 100+ semantic rules (operate on L3 output)
- V4: 42+ style rules (operate on L4 output)
- Total: 542 validation rules across all layers

**Integration**: Complete rule system documented in `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section III

---

## V. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: Performance Constraints
**Uncertainty**: Token growth limits, macro call limits - hard limits or guidelines?

**Clarification Provided**:
- Token growth: 8,192 tokens maximum per document (hard limit)
- Macro calls: 512 calls maximum per document (hard limit)  
- Expansion depth: 32 levels maximum (hard limit)
- Error behavior when exceeded: Return specific error types

**Integration**: Performance requirements in `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md` Section VI

### Original Problem: LaTeX ε Constraints
**Uncertainty**: How are acyclic_bodies enforced?

**Clarification Provided**:
- Syntactic constraints enforced at macro definition time
- acyclic_bodies = true means no macro can reference itself
- Static analysis during `\newcommand` processing
- Runtime cycle detection during expansion

**Integration**: Constraint details in `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md` and `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

## VI. DATA FLOW → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: Unclear Processing Pipeline
**Uncertainty**: Complete data flow from input file to validation results?

**Clarification Provided**: Complete 12-step processing flow:
```
1. Input: document.tex (string)
2. L0 Lexer: string → list latex_token  
3. V1 Rules: Apply token-level validation
4. L1 Expander: list latex_token → expand_result
5. V1½ Rules: Apply post-expansion validation  
6. L2 Parser: expanded_tokens → AST
7. V2 Rules: Apply structural validation
8. L3 Interpreter: AST → semantic_model
9. V3 Rules: Apply semantic validation
10. L4 Stylesheet: semantic_model → formatted_document
11. V4 Rules: Apply style validation
12. Output: PDF + validation_report
```

**Integration**: Complete data flow in `docs/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md` Section IV

**Uncertainty**: How to implement correctly without making assumptions?

**Clarification Provided**:

- Step-by-step implementation guide with code templates
- Common patterns and debugging assistance
- Test-driven development approach
- Integration strategies

**Integration**: Complete implementation guide in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

### Original Problem: Integration Requirements
**Uncertainty**: How does L1 integrate with L0 and enable V1½?

**Clarification Provided**:
- L0→L1: Direct `list latex_token` consumption
- L1→V1½: Expanded tokens available for post-expansion validation
- L1→L2: Same token type output for parser consumption
- State management and error propagation specifications

**Integration**: Integration requirements in `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md` Section VII

## VIII. TIMELINE AND DEPENDENCIES → RESOLUTION

### Original Problem: Confusing Project Timeline
**Uncertainty**: Current week number? What's actually implemented?

**Clarification Provided**:
- L0 Lexer: 100% complete (verified 2025-07-13)
- L1 Expander: Month 3-4 (current work)
- L2-L4 Pipeline: Months 7-12 per roadmap
- V1 Rules: Can start immediately (parallel with L1)
