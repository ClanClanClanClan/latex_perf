## 🛠️ TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Compilation Errors Resolved
1. **PostExpansionRules.v scope issue**:
   - Fixed `let rec` syntax → proper `Fixpoint` definition
   - Resolved `check_nesting` function scope error

2. **Token type corrections**:
   - Fixed `TOpen`/`TClose` → `TBeginGroup`/`TEndGroup`
   - Aligned with actual `latex_token` type definition

3. **Import dependencies**:
   - Removed references to archived `ExpanderCompat` module
   - Updated test files for current module structure

### Build System Improvements
- Cleaned 219 compiled artifacts from source tree
- Improved .gitignore coverage
- Established systematic build process
