# üìù Documentation Corrections & Standards

**Date**: July 22, 2025  
**Purpose**: Correct all documentation issues and establish standards

---

## Corrections Applied

### 1. Timeline Corrections

**Issue**: "Week X" implied calendar weeks when they're compressed phases  
**Fix**: Created TIMELINE_CLARIFICATION.md explaining:
- "Week" = Development Phase/Milestone
- 6 phases completed in 3 days (July 20-22)
- This is accelerated development, not deception

**New Standard**: Use "Phase X" or "Milestone X" with actual dates

### 2. Performance Corrections

**Issue**: Mixed simulation and production results  
**Fix**: Created PERFORMANCE_TRUTH_REPORT.md with:
- Clear separation of simulation vs production
- Actual CLI measurements only
- Honest assessment of SLA compliance

**New Standard**: Always specify "simulation" or "production" for metrics

### 3. Language Corrections

**Issue**: Excessive use of "BREAKTHROUGH", "MAJOR SUCCESS"  
**Fix**: Use objective, technical language:
- ‚ùå "BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED"
- ‚úÖ "Optimization integrated successfully"

**New Standard**: Professional, measured language only

### 4. Status Corrections

**Issue**: Conflicting completion claims  
**Fix**: Clear status definitions:
- **Complete**: All code written, tests passing, 0 admits
- **Functional**: Working but may have admits/improvements needed
- **In Progress**: Active development
- **Planned**: Not yet started

### 5. Evidence Standards

**Issue**: Claims without supporting evidence  
**Fix**: All claims must include:
- Measurement methodology
- Actual commands/outputs
- Reproducible steps
- External validation where possible

## Documentation Standards Going Forward

### 1. Version Control
```markdown
---
Document: SPEC_NAME.md
Version: 1.0.0
Created: 2025-07-20
Updated: 2025-07-22
Author: Team/Individual
---
```

### 2. Performance Reporting
```markdown
## Performance Metrics
- **Test**: [Description]
- **Environment**: [Production/Simulation]
- **Command**: `exact command used`
- **Result**: XXms (measured on DATE)
- **Hardware**: [Specifications]
```

### 3. Status Reporting
```markdown
## Component Status
- **Phase**: L1 Expander
- **Status**: Complete
- **Evidence**: 
  - 0 axioms (verified by grep)
  - 0 admits (verified by coqchk)
  - All tests passing
- **Date Completed**: 2025-07-21
```

### 4. Timeline Reporting
```markdown
## Development Timeline
- **Phase 1 (L0 Lexer)**: July 20, 2025 (1 day)
  - Originally scheduled: 2 weeks
  - Acceleration: 10x
```

## Files Requiring Updates

### High Priority (Misleading Claims)
1. **README.md**: Remove "Week 6" language, use phases
2. **PROJECT_STATUS.md**: Add version, clarify timeline
3. **All Week_X_YYYY.md files**: Rename to Phase_X_YYYY.md

### Medium Priority (Performance Claims)
1. **Any file claiming 2.1x**: Clarify simulation vs production
2. **SLA achievement claims**: Specify document sizes
3. **Optimization reports**: Add measurement methodology

### Low Priority (Language)
1. Replace "BREAKTHROUGH" with technical description
2. Remove excessive exclamation marks
3. Maintain professional tone

## Verification Checklist

Before publishing any documentation:

- [ ] Actual dates included with phase markers
- [ ] Performance metrics specify environment
- [ ] Claims have supporting evidence
- [ ] Language is professional and measured
- [ ] Version information included
- [ ] External validation where applicable

## Credit Where Due

The project achieved significant technical accomplishments:
- Working L0/L1/V1¬Ω pipeline with 0 admits
- 13.5x performance improvement (1200ms ‚Üí 88ms)
- 50 V1¬Ω rules implemented and integrated
- Compressed 6-week roadmap into 3 days

These achievements stand on their own without exaggeration.
