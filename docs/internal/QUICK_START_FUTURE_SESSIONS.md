# LaTeX Perfectionist v24 - Quick Start for Future Sessions

**üö® START HERE üö®** - Foolproof entry point for continuing work  
**Last Updated**: 2025-07-24  
**Current Status**: 64% Complete - Ready for Final 36% Push  

---

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP

### **CRITICAL**: Follow the Technical Implementation Roadmap

**Current State**: Solid 64% foundation with working formal lexer  
**Next Phase**: Fix comment edge case ‚Üí Full corpus validation ‚Üí Production  
**Roadmap**: `docs/internal/TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md` ‚Üê **READ THIS FIRST**

### **Phase 0: Orientation (¬Ω day)**
```bash
# 1. Verify build system works
make clean && make all

# 2. Run smoke test - MUST PASS before proceeding  
python3 src/integration/python-ocaml/fixed_integration.py

# 3. Read the 5 essential docs (in order):
# - docs/internal/QUICK_START_FUTURE_SESSIONS.md (this file)
# - docs/developer/MASTER_ARCHITECTURE.md  
# - docs/developer/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md
# - docs/developer/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
# - docs/internal/PROJECT_STATUS.md
```

### **Phase 1: Fix Comment Edge Case (1 day)**
**Goal**: Eliminate remaining 0.74% false positives

```bash
# Work in the core lexer
cd src/coq/lexer

# Edit Lexer.v to add comment_mode handling
# Follow detailed instructions in TECHNICAL_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md
# Update LexerProofs.v with new test cases
# Verify: coq Lexer.v && coq LexerProofs.v
```

### **Critical Success Gates**
- [ ] **Build Test**: `make clean && make all` succeeds  
- [ ] **Smoke Test**: Integration demo shows ‚úÖ for all test cases
- [ ] **Comment Fix**: 0% false positives on comment test cases
- [ ] **Corpus Test**: Full 2,846 paper validation shows 0 FP indicators

üìñ **Read Second**: `docs/LAYER_L1_SPECIFICATION.md`  
**Why**: Complete technical requirements for L1 Expander  
**Key Details**: 76 built-in macros, 3 proof targets, exact interface

### 3. Implementation Instructions (15 minutes) ‚úÖ MANDATORY
üìñ **Read Third**: `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`  
**Why**: Step-by-step coding instructions, common patterns  
**Key Help**: Debugging guide, success criteria, test strategies

### 4. Current Progress (5 minutes) üìã RECOMMENDED
üìñ **Read Fourth**: `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`  
**Why**: What's done, what's next, risk assessment  
**Key Status**: L0 complete, L1 ready to start

- [ ] Input: Token list from L0 Lexer (13 token types)
- [ ] Output: Expanded token list or error
- [ ] Built-ins: 76 specific macros cataloged
- [ ] Proofs: 3 specific theorems required

### ‚úÖ Implementation Strategy
- [ ] Create 6 files in `src/core/expander/`
- [ ] Start with `ExpanderTypes.v` for data types
- [ ] Follow step-by-step guide in `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Test each component as you build
- [ ] Maintain 0 axioms, 0 admits standard
