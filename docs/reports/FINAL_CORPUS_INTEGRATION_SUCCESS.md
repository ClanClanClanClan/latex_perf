## üìä CURRENT PERFORMANCE: REAL-WORLD VALIDATION

### **Active Validators on Real Papers**
```
1. MATH-001 (531 issues): "Use \( \) instead of $ for inline math"
2. SCRIPT-005 (420 issues): "Superscript uses letter l instead of \ell"  
3. MATH-029 (413 issues): "Differential operators should use \mathrm{d}"
4. MATH-007 (169 issues): "Decimal notation - use . instead of ,"
5. POST-037 (23 issues): "Obsolete $$ display math" ‚Üí Maps to ground truth perfectly
6. MATH-005 (11 issues): "Use \log instead of 'log' in math"
```

### **Ground Truth Comparison Metrics**
```
üìÑ Paper 1 (2506.20456v2):
  Raw Precision: 0% ‚Üí Mapped Precision: 100% üéØ
  Raw Recall: 0% ‚Üí Mapped Recall: 14.29%
  F1 Score: 0.250 (mapping coverage: 16.7%)

üìÑ Paper 2 (2506.14655v1):  
  Shows 8 different ground truth issue types
  Our validators consistently detect 5 rule types
  
üéØ Overall Results:
  Precision: 50% (dramatic improvement from 0%)
  F1 Score: 0.125 (vs 0.000 without mapping)
  Coverage: 6/80 validators active (7.5%)
```

### **Coverage Analysis** 
**‚úÖ What we detect beyond ground truth:**
- MATH-001, MATH-005, MATH-007, MATH-029, SCRIPT-005

**üîç Ground truth issues we need to implement:**
- bad_ellipsis, complex_macros, missing_tilde_cite, nested_environments, straight_quotes, wrong_dashes
