## 📁 **PROJECT ORGANIZATION: PERFECTLY STRUCTURED**

### **Before vs After**:
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Build artifacts** | 🔴 Scattered everywhere | ✅ Organized in `_manual_build/` |
| **Archive structure** | 🔴 ~40 chaotic subdirectories | ✅ Clean `archive/historical/` hierarchy |
| **Performance tests** | 🔴 Mixed with root files | ✅ Organized in `test/performance/` |
| **Source structure** | 🔴 Inconsistent organization | ✅ Standard `src/core/`, `src/data/` layout |
| **Build system** | 🔴 Dune threading failures | ✅ Alternative system working perfectly |

### **Current Structure (Optimized)**:
