81. **Integration Architecture**: How do all components integrate into a cohesive system?
    ```
    # What should the complete system architecture be?
    User Input → Preprocessing → L0-L4 Pipeline → Validator Execution → 
    Result Aggregation → Post-processing → User Output
    ```

82. **System Testing**: How should the complete system be tested?
    - End-to-end test scenarios?
    - Integration test automation?
    - Performance testing under load?

83. **Configuration Management**: How should system configuration be managed?
    - Configuration file formats and validation?
    - Runtime configuration updates?
    - Environment-specific configurations?

84. **Error Handling**: How should system-level errors be handled?
    - Error propagation and aggregation?
    - User-friendly error reporting?
    - Recovery and graceful degradation?

**Expected Output**: Complete system integration with:
- Integration architecture specification
- End-to-end testing framework
- Configuration management system
- Error handling and recovery procedures

### 12.2 Deployment and Operations

**Context**: Need production deployment and operational procedures.

**Current State**:
- Basic deployment concepts mentioned
- Missing: deployment automation, operational procedures

**Specific Technical Questions**:

85. **Deployment Strategy**: How should the system be deployed?
    - Container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)?
    - Infrastructure as code (Terraform, etc.)?
    - Blue-green or rolling deployment strategies?

86. **Operational Monitoring**: How should the system be monitored in production?
    - Health check implementations?
    - Performance monitoring and alerting?
    - Log aggregation and analysis?

87. **Backup and Recovery**: How should data be backed up and recovered?
    - Backup strategies for different data types?
    - Disaster recovery procedures?
    - Business continuity planning?

**Expected Output**: Complete deployment and operations framework with:
- Automated deployment procedures
- Production monitoring and alerting
- Backup and disaster recovery systems
- Operational runbooks and procedures

## CONCLUSION

This document identifies **87 specific technical questions** across **12 major gap categories** that must be resolved before LaTeX Perfectionist v25 implementation can proceed. Each question is precisely formulated to enable an AI agent to provide detailed, actionable solutions.

The resolution of these gaps will provide:
- Complete technical architecture
- Detailed implementation procedures
- Performance optimization strategies
- Integration and deployment guidance
- Quality assurance frameworks

**Priority**: Focus on Critical Path Blockers first (Questions 1-30) as these are fundamental architecture decisions that affect all other components.

**Timeline**: Gap resolution should be completed before implementation begins to avoid costly architectural changes during development.
