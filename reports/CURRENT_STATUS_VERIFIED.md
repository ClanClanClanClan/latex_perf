## CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT - HONEST

### What Actually Works
1. **Project Planning**: âœ… Comprehensive project structure
2. **Architecture Design**: ðŸš€ UVSNA unified approach designed
3. **Timeline Planning**: âœ… 26-week timeline established
4. **Documentation Framework**: ðŸš€ In development
5. **Development Environment**: ðŸš€ Being prepared

### What Doesn't Work Yet
1. **UVSNA Implementation**: ðŸ“… Week 3 deliverable
2. **CARC Integration**: ðŸ“… Week 4 deliverable
3. **Performance Validation**: ðŸ“… Week 5 deliverable
4. **Complete Rule Processing**: ðŸ“… Requires implementation
5. **Production Deployment**: ðŸ“… Week 25-26 deliverable

### What Needs Clarification
1. **Rule Count**: Target of 3,696 lines containing 499 actual rules (with comments and formatting) for classification
2. **Implementation Scope**: UVSNA complexity and integration requirements
3. **Performance Targets**: **TARGET: <42ms SLA (not measured)** - to be established and measured in Week 5
4. **Proof Strategy**: Systematic approach to completing 38 admits
