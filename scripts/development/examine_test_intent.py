    # 1. For American English (en-US), punctuation should go inside quotes
    # 2. The period is at the end of the sentence, not inside the quote
    # 3. So the rule shouldn't really apply here since the period isn't related to the quote
    
    # However, the test expects issues=True, which suggests it wants something to be flagged
    # Maybe the intent is that quotes inside LaTeX commands should still follow punctuation rules?
