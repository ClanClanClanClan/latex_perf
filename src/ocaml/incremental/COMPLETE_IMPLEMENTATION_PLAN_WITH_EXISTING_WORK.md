# COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: Building on Existing Work

## LaTeX Perfectionist v24-R3 - From 80 to 542 Rules

This plan properly accounts for the **existing implementation** and maps a realistic path to v24-R3 compliance.

---

## 1. Current Implementation Summary

### 1.1 What's Already Built

**Working Systems**:
- ✅ **L0 Lexer**: Complete with formal verification
- ✅ **L1 Expander**: Basic version operational (needs proofs)
- ✅ **80 Validators**: Phase 1 rules implemented and verified
- ✅ **VSNA Architecture**: Unified state machine (our innovation)
- ✅ **CARC System**: 499 rules classified for context-sensitivity
- ✅ **CLI Tool**: Production-ready with performance monitoring
- ✅ **Incremental Lexer**: 4,955x speedup (our innovation)

**Performance Achievement**:
- Current: 6.01ms processing time
- Target: 42ms
- **Status**: ✅ Exceeding target by 7x

### 1.2 Gap to v24-R3 Compliance

| Requirement | Have | Need | Gap |
|------------|------|------|-----|
| Validators | 80 | 542 | 462 |
| L0 Lexer | ✅ Complete | ✅ | 0 |
| L1 Expander | Basic | +Proofs | 3 theorems |
| L2 Parser | ❌ | PEG | 100% |
| L3 Interpreter | ❌ | Full | 100% |
| CI Validation | Basic | pdfTeX | 80% |

## 2. Leveraging Existing Architecture

### 2.1 VSNA + CARC Foundation

**Our Innovation** (not in spec but valuable):
```coq
(* VSNA provides unified processing pipeline *)
VSNA State Machine → CARC Classification → Rule Validation → Output

(* This architecture can support all 542 rules *)
```

**Strategy**: Use VSNA/CARC as the integration layer for new components.

### 2.2 Incremental Lexer Advantage

**Our Achievement**: 4,955x speedup through incremental processing

**Integration Plan**:
- Keep incremental lexer for performance
- Use batch mode for verification/proofs
- Prove equivalence: `incremental_output = batch_output`

---

## 3. Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: L1 Expander Completion (Weeks 1-6)

**Goal**: Add formal proofs to existing expander

**Tasks**:
1. **Week 1-2**: Implement fuel mechanism
   ```coq
   Definition expand (fuel: nat) (tokens: list token) : option (list token)
   ```

2. **Week 3-4**: Prove three theorems
   - `expand_fuel_insensitive`
   - `expand_terminates_acyclic`  
   - `expand_no_teof`

3. **Week 5-6**: Integration
   - Connect to VSNA pipeline
   - Enable Phase 1.5 validators

**Deliverable**: L1 compliant with proofs

### Phase 2: High-Value Validators (Weeks 7-14)

**Goal**: Implement 100 most-requested validators

**Strategy**: Use CARC classifications to prioritize:
- High confidence CST rules first
- User-reported pain points
- Academic paper requirements

**Implementation Rate**: 12-15 validators/week
- Reuse patterns from existing 80
- Batch similar rules
- Automated testing

**Deliverable**: 180 working validators

### Phase 3: L2 Parser Development (Weeks 15-26)

**Goal**: Implement PEG parser for LaTeX epsilon

**Approach**:
1. **Weeks 15-18**: Parser design
   - Define AST structure
   - Create PEG grammar
   - Handle LaTeX quirks

2. **Weeks 19-22**: Implementation
   - Parser combinator approach
   - Error recovery
   - Performance optimization

3. **Weeks 23-26**: Verification
   - `parse_sound` proof
   - Integration with VSNA
   - Enable Phase 2 validators

**Deliverable**: Working L2 parser

### Phase 4: Core L3 Interpreter (Weeks 27-34)

**Goal**: Semantic analysis capability

**Simplified Approach**:
- Focus on semantic state needed for rules
- Not full LaTeX interpretation
- Pragmatic subset

**Key Components**:
- Cross-reference tracking
- Environment nesting
- Counter management
- Label resolution

**Deliverable**: L3 sufficient for Phase 3 rules

### Phase 5: Validator Sprint (Weeks 35-50)

**Goal**: Implement remaining ~280 validators

**Strategy**:
- 4-person team
- 20 validators/week team rate
- Reuse patterns aggressively
- Parallel development

**Breakdown**:
- Phase 2 validators: 150 rules (7 weeks)
- Phase 3 validators: 100 rules (5 weeks)
- Phase 4 validators: 30 rules (2 weeks)

### Phase 6: CI and Polish (Weeks 51-56)

**Goal**: Full v24-R3 compliance

**Tasks**:
1. pdfTeX translation validation
2. 500-document corpus testing
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation
5. Formal release

## 4. Resource Plan

### 4.1 Team Structure

| Role | FTE | Duration | Focus |
|------|-----|----------|-------|
| Coq Expert | 1.0 | 56 weeks | Proofs, verification |
| Parser Developer | 1.0 | 20 weeks | L2 implementation |

## 5. Risk Mitigation

### 5.1 Technical Risks

**Risk**: Parser complexity
**Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate
- Basic parser first

## 8. Conclusion

This plan acknowledges the **significant work already done** and plots a realistic path to v24-R3 compliance. Key differences from starting fresh:

1. **L0 already complete** - Saves 8-10 weeks
2. **80 validators working** - Patterns proven
3. **Architecture solid** - VSNA/CARC can scale
4. **Performance solved** - Incremental lexer done

**Total Timeline**: 56 weeks (vs 70+ from scratch)
**Confidence Level**: 75% (vs 40% from scratch)
**Investment**: $800K (6.5 FTE × 56 weeks)

The existing foundation significantly reduces risk and timeline. The main challenges remain L2 parser development and scaling to 542 validators, but with proven patterns and architecture, this is achievable.
