# Hell-Level Test Summary

## Created Test Files

### 1. Security Tests (`tests/security/HELL_LEVEL_SECURITY_TESTS.v`)
- ✅ Compiles successfully
- Tests adversarial inputs and security vulnerabilities:
  - Command injection attempts
  - Shell metacharacter injection
  - Path traversal attacks
  - Buffer overflow attempts
  - Denial of service patterns
  - Unicode attacks (homographs, RTL override)
  - Null byte injection
  - Format string attacks
  - Integer overflow
  - Control characters
  - Polyglot files
  - XML entity expansion
  - Timing consistency

### 2. Edge Case Tests (`tests/edge_cases/HELL_LEVEL_EDGE_CASES.v`)
- ✅ Compiles successfully
- Tests extreme boundary conditions:
  - Empty and minimal inputs
  - Whitespace edge cases (zero-width spaces, mixed whitespace)
  - Command edge cases (empty commands, long names, numbers)
  - Bracket and delimiter nesting
  - Math mode edge cases
  - Special character sequences
  - Comment edge cases
  - Environment edge cases
  - Numeric edge cases
  - Encoding edge cases (BOM, mixed line endings)
  - Stress tests (deep nesting, repeated patterns)

### 3. Performance Tests (`tests/performance/HELL_LEVEL_PERFORMANCE_TESTS.v`)
- ❌ Compilation issues due to exact token count assertions
- Tests performance boundaries:
  - Large document processing
  - Deep nesting performance
  - Many tokens handling
  - Multiple validator execution
  - Rule execution scaling
  - Memory stress tests
  - Pathological inputs
  - Worst-case complexity patterns
  - Concurrent validation
  - Performance regression guards

### 4. Simplified Performance Tests (`tests/performance/SIMPLE_PERFORMANCE_TESTS.v`)
- ✅ Basic tests compile (with adjustments needed)
- Simpler performance verification

## Test Coverage Achieved

### Security (Hell-Level ✅)
- Injection attacks: Command, shell, path traversal
- Memory attacks: Buffer overflow, integer overflow
- DoS patterns: Regex bombs, recursive expansion
- Unicode attacks: Homographs, directional overrides
- Format attacks: Format strings, null bytes
- Polyglot and XXE patterns

### Edge Cases (Hell-Level ✅)
- Empty/minimal inputs
- Boundary values
- Malformed constructs
- Deep nesting
- Special characters
- Mixed encodings

### Performance (Partial)
- Basic performance verification
- Scaling tests need adjustment for actual token counts
- Memory and complexity tests defined

## Outstanding Issues

1. **OCaml Extraction**: Type compatibility issues remain
2. **Performance Tests**: Need adjustment for actual computed values
3. **Integration**: Full pipeline testing still pending

## Recommendations

1. The security and edge case tests provide comprehensive adversarial coverage
2. Performance tests need runtime measurement rather than static assertions
3. Consider adding fuzzing for discovering new edge cases
4. Add property-based testing for soundness verification
