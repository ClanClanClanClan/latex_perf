In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic torsion of congruence quotients of $\SL(n,\R)/\SO(n)$ in terms of the volume. The result is based on a new bound on the trace of the heat kernel in this setting, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital integrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires the existence of $\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define and show exists in plenitude for any $\lambda$. The motivation is possible applications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups, although the connection in this setting is as of yet conjectural.
