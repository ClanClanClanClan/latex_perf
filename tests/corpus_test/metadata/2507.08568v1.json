  "abstract": "This article gives an expository account of quasisyntomic descent and the\nNygaard filtration in positive characteristic, complemented by several new\napplications to $p$-adic cohomology theories. The guiding result is a new\napproach to Illusie's comparison between fppf cohomology with $\\mathbb{Z}_p(1)$\ncoefficients and the slope $1$ part of crystalline cohomology. We follow work\nof Bhatt-Lurie, but give a more elementary presentation which does not rely on\nthe formalism of $\\infty$-categories. We then revisit Ogus' comparison theorem\nbetween infinitesimal cohomology and \\'etale cohomology, and give new proofs of\nseveral results on fppf cohomology that were previously obtained with the de\nRham-Witt complex. We also determine the action of multiplication-by-$n$ on the\nfppf cohomology of an abelian variety, answering a question of A. Skorobogatov\nto the author. This is an expanded version of the author's master thesis.",
