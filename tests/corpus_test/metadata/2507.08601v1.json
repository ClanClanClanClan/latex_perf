  "abstract": "In this follow-up paper, we inspect a surprising relationship between the set\nof $2$-periodic points of a polynomial map $\\varphi_{d, c}$ defined by\n$\\varphi_{d, c}(z) = z^d + c$ for all $c, z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ and the coefficient\n$c$, where $d>2$ is an integer. As in the previous articles, we again wish to\nstudy here counting problems that are inspired by exciting advances of\nBhargava-Shankar-Tsimerman and their collaborators on $2$-torsion\npoint-counting in arithmetic statistics, and also by Hutz's conjecture and\nPanraksa's work on $2$-periodic point-counting in arithmetic dynamics. In doing\nso, we then first prove that for any given prime $p\\geq 3$, the average number\nof distinct $2$-periodic integral points of any polynomial map $\\varphi_{p, c}$\nmodulo $p$ is either zero or unbounded as $c$ tends to infinity. Furthermore,\ninspired by a conjecture of Hutz on $2$-periodic rational points of any\npolynomial map $\\varphi_{p-1, c}$ for any given prime $p\\geq 5$ in arithmetic\ndynamics, we then also prove that the average number of distinct $2$-periodic\nintegral points of any $\\varphi_{p-1, c}$ modulo $p$ is equal to $1$ or $2$ or\n$0$ as $c$ tends to infinity. Finally, as in the previous follow-up articles,\nwe then also apply here density and number field-counting results from\narithmetic statistics, and consequently obtain again several counting and\nstatistical results on the irreducible monic integer polynomials and on the\nalgebraic number fields arising naturally in our dynamical setting.",
