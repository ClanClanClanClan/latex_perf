  "abstract": "We consider the large deviations at the order of the variance for the central\nvalue of a family of $L$-functions among the members with bounded discriminant.\nWhen there is an upper bound on an integer moment of the central value twisted\nby a short Dirichlet polynomial, we can establish upper bounds on the density\nof members exhibiting a large central value. We adapt the techniques from\nArguin and Bailey for large deviations of the Riemann zeta function to prove\nresults on the degree two family of quadratic twists of an elliptic curve. This\nupper bound improves on density results previously obtained by Radziwi\\l{\\l}\nand Soundararajan.",
