  "abstract": "Experimental calculations suggest that the $h$-fold sumset sizes of 4-element\nsets of integers are concentrated at $h$ numbers that are differences of\ntetrahedral numbers. In this paper it is proved that these \"popular\" sumset\nsizes exist and explicit $h$-adically defined sets are constructed for each of\nthese numbers.",
