  "abstract": "We develop a reduction theory for the representation of $\\mathrm{SL}_n$ on\npairs of symmetric $n\\times n$ matrices. We apply this theory to the pencils of\nquadrics arising from divisors on hyperelliptic curves. We use these results to\nshow that, in a density $1$ family, an odd degree point $P$ of degree at most\n$2g-1$ on the hyperelliptic curve $z^2 = f_0x^{2g+2} + f_1 x^{2g+1} y + \\cdots\n+ f_{2g+2}y^{2g+2}$ cannot have small Weil height.",
