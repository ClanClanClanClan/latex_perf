  "abstract": "We prove functional equations for multiple Dirichlet series defined by a\ncollection of five geometric axioms. We find functional equations of two types:\none modeled on the functional equations of Dirichlet $L$-functions, and another\nmodeled on the functional equations of Kubota $L$-series with Gauss sums as\ncoefficients. These functional equations generate groupoid structures, which we\nrelate to the Weyl groupoids of arithmetic root systems. From the known\nclassification of arithmetic root systems, we obtain a complete classification\nof multiple Dirichlet series which can be used to compute moments of\n$L$-functions via established analytic techniques. Our classification includes\nall moments of $L$-functions which have appeared in the multiple Dirichlet\nseries literature previously, alongside some new moments. Finally, we give\napplications of our functional equations to quantum algebra, specifically the\ncohomology of Nichols algebras.",
