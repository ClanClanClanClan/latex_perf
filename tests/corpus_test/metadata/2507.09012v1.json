  "abstract": "Let $k\\ge 1$ be an integer. A positive integer $n$ is $k$-\\textit{gleeful} if\n$n$ can be represented as the sum of $k$th powers of consecutive primes. For\nexample, $35=2^3+3^3$ is a $3$-gleeful number, and $195=5^2+7^2+11^2$ is\n$2$-gleeful. In this paper, we present some new results on $k$-gleeful numbers\nfor $k>1$.\n  First, we extend previous analytical work. For given values of $x$ and $k$,\nwe give explicit upper and lower bounds on the number of $k$-gleeful\nrepresentations of integers $n\\le x$.\n  Second, we describe and analyze two new, efficient parallel algorithms, one\ntheoretical and one practical, to generate all $k$-gleeful representations up\nto a bound $x$.\n  Third, we study integers that are multiply gleeful, that is, integers with\nmore than one representation as a sum of powers of consecutive primes,\nincluding both the same or different values of $k$. We give a simple heuristic\nmodel for estimating the density of multiply-gleeful numbers, we present\nempirical data in support of our heuristics, and offer some new conjectures.",
