  "abstract": "This is a continuation of the adelic version of Kwan's formula. At\nnon-archimedean places we give a bound of the weight function on the mixed\nmoment side, when the weight function on the $\\mathrm{PGL}_3 \\times\n\\mathrm{PGL}_2$ side is nearly the characteristic function of a short family.\nOur method works for any tempered representation $\\Pi$ of $\\mathrm{PGL}_3$, and\nreveals the structural reason for the appearance of Katz's hypergeometric sums\nin a previous joint work with P.Xi.",
