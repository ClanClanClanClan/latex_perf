  "abstract": "We consider some $q$-series which depend on a pair of positive integers\n$(k,m)$. While positivity of these series holds for the first few values of\n$(k,m)$, the situation is quite unclear for other values of $(k,m)$. In\naddition, our series generate the number of certain two-color integer\npartitions weighted by $(-1)^j$ where $j$ is the number of even parts.\nTherefore, inequalities involving these partitions will be deduced from the\npositivity of their generating functions.",
