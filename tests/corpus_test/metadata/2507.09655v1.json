  "abstract": "We continue generalizing Altu\\u{g}'s work on $\\mathsf{GL}_2$ over\n$\\mathbb{Q}$ in the unramified setting for \\emph{Beyond Endoscopy} to the\nramified case where ramification occurs at $S=\\{\\infty,q_1,\\dots,q_r\\}$ with\n$2\\in S$, after generalizing the first step. We establish a new proof of the\n$1/4$ bound towards the Ramanujan conjecture for the trace of the cuspidal part\nin the ramified case, which is also provided by adapting Altu\\u{g}'s original\napproach. The proof proceeds in three stages: First, we estimate the\ncontributions from the non-elliptic parts of the trace formula. Then, we apply\nthe main result from our the previous work to isolate the $1$-dimensional\nrepresentations within the elliptic part. Finally, we employ technical analytic\nestimates to bound the remainder terms in the elliptic part.",
