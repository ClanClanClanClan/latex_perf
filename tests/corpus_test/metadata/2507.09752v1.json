  "abstract": "In recent work, Amdeberhan and Merca considered the integer partition\nfunction $a(n)$ which counts the number of integer partitions of weight $n$\nwherein even parts come in only one color (i.e., they are monochromatic), while\nthe odd parts may appear in one of three colors. One of the results that they\nproved was that, for all $n\\geq 0$, $a(7n+2) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. In this work,\nwe generalize this function $a(n)$ by naturally placing it within an infinite\nfamily of related partition functions. Using elementary generating function\nmanipulations and classical $q$--series identities, we then prove infinitely\nmany congruences modulo 7 which are satisfied by members of this family of\nfunctions.",
