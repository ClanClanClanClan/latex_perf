  "abstract": "Let $(m, n, k)$ be a tuple of integers with the property that if $i \\leq k$,\nthen $m + i$ and $n + i$ have the same radical. Using a result on the abc\nConjecture, we bound $k$ from above, improving a result of Balasubramanian,\nShorey, and Waldschmidt. We also bound the number of pairs $(m, n)$ for which\n$m < n \\leq x$ and $m(m + 1) \\cdots (m + k - 1))$ and $n(n + 1) \\cdots (n +\n\\ell - 1)$ have the same radical and the number of pairs for which $m + i$ and\n$n + i$ have the same radical for all $i < k$.",
