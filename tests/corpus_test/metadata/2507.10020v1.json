  "abstract": "Ramanujan listed several q-series identities in his lost notebook. The most\nwell\n  known q-series identities are the Rogers-Ramanujan type identities which are\nfirst discovered\n  by Rogers and then rediscovered by Ramanujan. In this paper, we give\npartition-theoretic\n  interpretations of some of the Rogers-Ramanujan type identities using\noverpartition and\n  colour partition of positive integers, and prove infinite families of\ncongruences modulo powers\n  of 2.",
