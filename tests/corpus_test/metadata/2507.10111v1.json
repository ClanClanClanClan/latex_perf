  "abstract": "The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points\non a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\\'a\\v{r}'s $p$-adic height\npairing which replaces $\\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear\nboth what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it.\nThis paper explores the relavence of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this\nproblem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve\nand the Albanese kernel of $X\\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm\nto compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the\nJacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of\nthe nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.",
