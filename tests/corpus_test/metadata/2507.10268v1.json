  "abstract": "This paper explores relations between two separate worlds. They are the\nalgebraic geometry of Alexander Grothendieck and the automorphic representation\ntheory of Robert Langlands. The relation between them would be a very broad\nexample of the fundamental duality between geometric objects and spectral\nobjects that permeates much of modern mathematics. Our goal is to introduce\nexplicit conjectural constructions of the universal groups that govern much of\nthese theories, and to explore the relations between them.",
