  "abstract": "In this paper we prove a sharpened asymptotic for the growth of analytic\ntorsion of congruence quotients of\n$\\operatorname{SL}(n,\\mathbb{R})/\\operatorname{SO}(n)$ in terms of the volume.\nThe result is based on a new bound on the trace of the heat kernel in this\nsetting, allowing control of the large time behaviour of certain orbital\nintegrals, as well as a careful analysis of error terms. The result requires\nthe existence of $\\lambda$-strongly acyclic representations, which we define\nand show exists in plenitude for any $\\lambda$. The motivation is possible\napplications to torsion in the cohomology of arithmetic groups, although the\nconnection in this setting is as of yet conjectural.",
