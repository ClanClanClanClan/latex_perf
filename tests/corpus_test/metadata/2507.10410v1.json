  "abstract": "In this work, we relate recent work of Yuan--Zhang and Song on adelic line\nbundles over quasi-projective arithmetic varieties to recent advances in\npluripotential theory on global Berkovich spaces from Pille-Schneider. In\nparticular, we establish an equivalence between subcategories of adelic line\nbundles on quasi-projective varieties and line bundles on their Berkovich\nanalytifications equipped with a continuous plurisubharmonic metric. We also\nprovide several applications of this equivalence. For example, we generalize a\nconstruction of Pille-Schneider concerning families of Monge--Amp\\`ere measures\non analytifications of projective arithmetic varieties to the quasi-projective\nsetting. With this construction, we offer a new description of non-degenerate\nsubvarieties which involves Monge--Amp\\`ere measures over trivially valued\nfields. Finally, we define a Monge--Amp\\`ere measure on the analytification of\na quasi-projective arithmetic variety.",
