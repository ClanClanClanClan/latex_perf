  "abstract": "Let $r,\\,f$ be multiplicative functions with $r\\geqslant 0$, $f$ is complex\nvalued, $|f|\\leqslant r$, and $r$ satisfies some standard growth hypotheses.\nLet $x$ be large, and assume that, for some real number $\\tau$, the quantities\n$r(p)-\\Re\\{f(p)/p^{i\\tau}\\}$ are small in various appropriate average senses\nover the set of prime numbers not exceeding $x$. We derive from recent\neffective mean-value estimates an effective comparison theorem between the\nmean-values of $f$ and of $r$ on the set of integers $\\leqslant x$. We also\nprovide effective estimates for certain weighted moments of additive functions\nand for sifted mean-values of non-negative multiplicative functions.",
