  "abstract": "Let $q$ be a prime power and $\\mathbb{F}_q$ the finite field with $q$\nelements. For a positive integer $n$, the polynomial $X^n - 1 \\in\n\\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ is termed $3$-sparse over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ if all its\nirreducible factors in $\\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ are either binomials or trinomials. In\n2021, Oliveira and Reis characterized all positive integers $n$ for which $X^n\n- 1$ is 3-sparse over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ when $q = 2$ and $q = 4$. Recently, the\nauthor provided a complete characterization for odd $q$. This paper extends the\ninvestigation to finite fields of even characteristic, fully determining all\n$n$ such that $X^n - 1$ is 3-sparse over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ for even $q$. This work\nresolves two open problems posed by Oliveira and Reis for even characteristic\ncase.",
