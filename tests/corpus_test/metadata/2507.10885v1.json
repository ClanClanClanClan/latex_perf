  "abstract": "S. Cappell and J. Shaneson constructed a pair of inequivalent embeddings of\n$(n-1)$-spheres in homotopy $(n+1)$-spheres for every square matrix of order\n$n$ with special properties (a Cappell-Shaneson matrix). A Cappell-Shaneson\npolynomial is the characteristic polynomial of a Cappell-Shaneson matrix. In\nthis paper, we interpret part of the definition of Cappell-Shaneson polynomial\nas algebraic conditions on polynomials in terms of signed reciprocal polynomial\nand reduction modulo primes, and give complete lists of all Cappell-Shaneson\npolynomials of degrees $4$ and $5$. We construct several infinite series of\nCappell-Shaneson polynomials of degree $6$.",
