  "abstract": "Motivated by the convolutive behavior of the counting function for partitions\nwith designated summands in which all parts are odd, we consider coefficient\nsequences $(a_n)_{n\\ge 0}$ of primitive eta-products that satisfy the generic\nconvolutive property\n  \\begin{align*}\n  \\sum_{n\\ge 0} a_{mn} q^n = \\left(\\sum_{n\\ge 0} a_n q^n\\right)^m\n  \\end{align*}\n  for a specific positive integer $m$. Given the results of an exhaustive\nsearch of the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for such sequences for\n$m$ up to $6$, we first focus on the case where $m=2$ with our attention mainly\npaid to the combinatorics of two $2$-convolutive sequences, featuring bijective\nproofs for both. For other $2$-convolutive sequences discovered in the OEIS, we\napply generating function manipulations to show their convolutivity. We also\ngive two examples of $3$-convolutive sequences. Finally, we discuss other\nconvolutive series that are not eta-products.",
