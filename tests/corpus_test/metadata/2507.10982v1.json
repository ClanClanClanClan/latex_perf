  "abstract": "In this paper, the Beatty multiple shift is introduced, which is a\ngeneralization of the multiplicative shift of finite type (multiple SFT)\n[Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak, Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems, 2012] and\nthe affine multiple shift [Ban, Hu, Lai and Liao, Advances in Mathematics,\n2025]. The Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension formulas are obtained, and the\ncoefficients of the formula is closely related to the classical disjoint\ncovering of the positive integers in number theory.",
