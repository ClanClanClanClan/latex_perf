  "abstract": "A spanning tree $T$ of a connected graph $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ that is a\ntree covers all vertices of $G$. The leaf distance of $T$ is defined as the\nminimum of distances between any two leaves of $T$. A fractional matching of a\ngraph $G$ is a function $h$ assigning every edge a real number in $[0,1]$ so\nthat $\\sum\\limits_{e\\in E_G(v)}{h(e)}\\leq1$ for any $v\\in V(G)$, where $E_G(v)$\ndenotes the set of edges incident with $v$ in $G$. A fractional matching of $G$\nis called a fractional perfect matching if $\\sum\\limits_{e\\in E_G(v)}{h(e)}=1$\nfor any $v\\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ with at least $2k+2$ vertices is said to be\nfractional $k$-extendable if every $k$-matching $M$ in $G$ is included in a\nfractional perfect matching $h$ of $G$ such that $h(e)=1$ for any $e\\in M$.\nThis paper considers a lower bound on the spectral radius of $G$ to guarantee\nthat $G$ has a spanning tree with leaf distance at least $d$. At the same time,\nwe obtain a lower bound on the spectral radius of $G$ to ensure that $G$ is\nfractional $k$-extendable.",
