  "abstract": "A connected forcing set of a graph is a zero forcing set that induces a\nconnected subgraph. In this paper, we introduce and study CF-dense graphs --\ngraphs in which every vertex belongs to some minimum connected forcing set. We\nidentify several CF-dense graph families and investigate the relationships\nbetween CF-density and analogous notions in zero forcing and total forcing. We\nalso characterize CF-dense trees and give a formula for the number of distinct\nconnected forcing sets in trees. Finally, we analyze when CF-density is\npreserved under graph operations such as Cartesian products, joins, and\ncoronas.",
