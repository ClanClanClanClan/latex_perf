  "abstract": "Ordered leaf attachment, Phylo2Vec, and HOP are three recently introduced\nvector representations for rooted phylogenetic trees where the representation\nis determined by an ordering of the underlying leaf set X. Comparing the\nvectors of two rooted phylogenetic X-trees T and T' for a fixed ordering on X\nleads to polynomial-time computable measure for the dissimilarity of T and T',\nalbeit dependent on the choice of the leaf ordering. For each of ordered leaf\nattachment, Phylo2Vec, and HOP, we compare this measure with the rooted subtree\nprune and regraft distance (rSPR), the hybrid number, and the temporal\ntree-child hybrid number of T and T'. Although there is no direct relationship\nbetween rSPR and any of the three vector-based measures, we show that, when\nminimized over all orderings, the hybrid number is equivalent to HOP, and an\nupper bound on the other two. Moreover, when minimized over all orderings\ninduced by common cherry-picking sequences of T and T', the temporal tree-child\nhybrid number of T and T' is equivalent to each of the three vector-based\nmeasures.",
