  "abstract": "We define a class of $C^k$-regular surfaces, $k \\geq 1$, \\emph{tileable\nsurfaces}, that admit geometric tilings by a finite number of congruence\nclasses of tiles. We show how to construct many examples, and examine the\nrelationship with the well known tilings of the plane and sphere, as well as\nmonohedral polyhedral surfaces.",
