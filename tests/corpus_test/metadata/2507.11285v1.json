  "abstract": "The $t$-intersecting Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem is the following statement: if\n$\\mathcal{F} \\subset \\binom{[n]}{k}$ is a $t$-intersecting family of sets and\n$n\\ge (t+1)(k-t+1)$, then $|\\mathcal{F}| \\le \\binom{n-t}{k-t}$. The first proof\nof this statement for all $t$ was a linear algebraic argument of Wilson.\nEarlier, Schrijver had proven the $t$-intersecting Erd\\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem\nfor sufficiently large $n$ by a seemingly different linear algebraic argument\nmotivated by Delsarte theory. In this note, we show that the approaches of\nSchrijver and Wilson are in fact equivalent.",
