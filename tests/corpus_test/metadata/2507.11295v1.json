  "abstract": "We statistically compare the relationships between frequencies of digits in\ncontinued fraction expansions of typical rational points in the unit interval\nand higher dimensional generalisations. This takes the form of a Large\nDeviation and Central Limit Theorem, including multidimensional results for\nrandom vectors. These results apply to classical multidimensional continued\nfraction transformations including Brun's algorithm and the Jacobi--Perron\nalgorithm, and more generally for maps satisfying mild contraction hypothesis\non the inverse branches. We prove in particular that the finite trajectories\ncapture the generic ergodic behaviour of infinite trajectories.",
