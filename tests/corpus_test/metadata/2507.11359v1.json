  "abstract": "The decision problem of perfect matchings in uniform hypergraphs is famously\nan NP-complete problem. It has been shown by Keevash--Knox--Mycroft [STOC,\n2013] that for every $\\varepsilon>0$, such decision problem restricted to\n$k$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ satisfying that every $(k-1)$-set of vertices is in\nat least $(1/k+\\varepsilon)|H|$ edges is tractable, and the quantity $1/k$ is\nbest possible. In this paper we study the existence of perfect matchings in the\nrandom $p$-sparsification of such $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, for\n$p=p(n)\\in [0,1]$, every edge is kept with probability $p$ independent of\nothers. As a consequence, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that with high\nprobability solves the decision problem; we also derive effective bounds on the\nnumber of perfect matchings in such hypergraphs. At last, similar results are\nobtained for the $F$-factor problem in graphs.\n  The key ingredients of the proofs are a strengthened partition lemma for the\nlattice-based absorption method, and the random redistribution method developed\nrecently by Kelly, M\\\"uyesser and Pokrovskiy, based on the spread method.",
