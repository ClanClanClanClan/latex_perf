  "abstract": "We discuss algebraic universality in the sense of P. Vogel for the simplest\nrefined quantity, the Macdonald dimensions. The main known source of universal\nquantities is given by Chern-Simons theory. Refinement of Chern-Simons theory\nmeans introducing additional parameters. At the level of symmetric functions,\nthe refinement is the transition from the Schur functions to the Macdonald\npolynomials. We consider the Macdonald polynomials associated with the simple\nLie algebras, define Macdonald dimensions and dual Macdonald dimensions, and\npresent a universal formula for them that unifies these quantities for algebras\nassociated with simply laced root systems. We also consider mixed Macdonald\ndimensions that depend on two different root systems.",
