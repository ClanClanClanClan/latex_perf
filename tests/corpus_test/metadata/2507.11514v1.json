  "abstract": "Let $K$ be a field of characteristic zero over which every diagonal form in\nsufficiently many variables admits a nontrivial solution. For example, $K$ may\nbe a totally imaginary number field or a finite extension of a $p$-adic field.\nSuppose $f_1,\\ldots,f_s$ are forms of degree $d$ over $K.$ Bik, Draisma and\nSnowden recently proved that there exists a constant $B = B(d,s,K)$ such that\nthe rational solutions to the system of equations $f_1=\\ldots=f_s = 0$ are\nZariski dense, as long as the Birch rank of $f_1,\\ldots,f_s$ is greater than\n$B.$ We establish an effective bound for this constant. Combined with results\nof Skinner, we obtain as a corollary a sufficient condition for the integer\nzeros of a system of forms over a number field to satisfy the Hardy-Littlewood\nasymptotic with a positive leading term. This corollary generalizes a seminal\nresult proved by Schmidt for the rational numbers.",
