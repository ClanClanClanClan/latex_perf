\begin{abstract}
We introduce the concept of the modularity of an abelian variety defined over the rational number field
extending the modularity of an elliptic curve. We discuss the modularity of an abelian variety over $\BQ$. We conjecture that a simple abelian variety over $\BQ$ is modular. The detailed article will appear later.

\begin{section}{{\bf The Modularity of an Elliptic Curve}}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\vskip 3mm
We set $\G_1:=SL(2,\BZ)$. For a positive integer $N$, we let $\G (N),\ \G_1 (N)$ and
$\G_0 (N)$ be the congruence subgroups of $\G_1$ such that $\G (N)\subset \G_1(N)
\subset \G_0 (N)\subset \G_1.$ We refer to \cite[pp.\,13--14,\,p.\,21]{Di-S}
for the precise definitions and properties of $\G (N),\ \G_1 (N)$ and $\G_0 (N)$.
Let $\BH_1$ be the Poincar{\'e} upper half plance. The quotient
\begin{equation*}
  Y_1(N):=\G_1(N)\ba \BH_1 \ ({\rm resp}.\  Y_0(N):=\G_0(N)\ba \BH_1)
\end{equation*}
be the complex manifold which has a natural model $Y_1(N)/\BQ$ (resp. $Y_0(N)/\BQ$).
We let $X_1(N)$ (resp. $X_0(N)$) be the smooth projective curve which contains
$Y_1(N)$ (resp. $Y_0(N)$) as a dense Zariski open subset (cf.\,see \cite[pp.\,45--60]{Di-S}).

\vskip 3mm
Let $S_k(N)$ be the space of cusp forms of weight $k\geq 1$ and level $N\geq 1$.
Here $k$ and $N$ be positive integers. We recall that
if $f\in S_k(N)$, it satisfies the following properties\,:
\vskip 2mm
(C1) $f((a\tau+b)(c\tau+d)^{-1})=(c\tau+d)^k f(\tau)$ for all
$\begin{pmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
 \end{pmatrix}\in \G_1(N)$ and $\tau\in \BH_1$;
\vskip 2mm
(C2) $| f(\tau)|^2 ({\rm Im}\,\tau)^k$ is bounded in $\BH_1$ and
\vskip 2mm
(C3) the Fourier expansion of $f(\tau)$ is given by
$$ f(\tau)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n (f)\, q^n,\quad {\rm where}\ q=e^{2\pi i\tau}.$$

We define the $L$-series of $f\in S_k(N)$ to be
$$ L(f,s):=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n (f)\,n^{-s}.$$

\vskip 2mm
For each prime $p\!\not| N$, we recall that the Hecke operator $T_p:S_k(N)\lrt S_k(N)$ is
defined by
\begin{equation*}
  (T_pf)(\tau)=p^{-1}\sum_{i=0}^{p-1} f\left(\frac{\tau+i}{p}\right)
  +p^{k-1} f\left(\frac{ap\tau+b}{cp\tau+d}\right), \quad f\in S_k (N)
\end{equation*}
for any $\begin{pmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
 \end{pmatrix}\in \G_1$ with $c\equiv 0\,({\rm mod}\,N)$ and $d\equiv p\,({\rm mod}\,N)$.
We refer to \cite[p.\,844]{BCDT} or \cite[pp.\,170--171]{Di-S} for more detail. The Hecke
operators $T_p\,(p\!\!\not| N)$ can be simultaneously diagonalized on $S_k (N)$ and
a simultaneous eigenvector a {\it Hecke\ eigenform} or simply an {\sf eigenform}.

\vskip 2mm
Let $\lambda$ be a place of the algebraic closure $\bar \BQ$ of $\BQ$ in $\BC$ lying over
a rational integer $\ell$ and ${\bar \BQ}_\lambda$ denote the algebraic closure of $\BQ_\ell$
via $\lambda$. Let $G_\BQ:={\rm Gal}({\bar \BQ}/\BQ)$ be the absolute Galois group of $\BQ$.
It is well known that if $f\in S_k (N)$ is a normalized eigenform with
$a_1(f)=1$, then there exists a unique continuous irreducible Galois representation
\begin{equation*}
  \rho_{f,\lambda}:G_\BQ\lrt GL(2,{\bar \BQ}_\lambda)
\end{equation*}
such that $\rho_{f,\lambda}$ is unramified at $p$ for all primes $p\!\!\not| \,\ell N$ and
\begin{equation*}
  {\rm Tr}\left(\rho_{f,\lambda}({\rm Frob}_p)\right)= a_p(f)\quad {\rm for\ any\ prime}\
p\!\!\not| \, \ell N.
\end{equation*}
The existence of $\rho_{f,\lambda}$ is due to Shimura if $k=2$ \cite{Sh2}, due to Deligne if
$k>2$ \cite{De} and due to Deligne and Serre if $k=1$ \cite{D-S}. We see that $\rho_{f,\lambda}$ is
odd in the sense that $\det \rho_{f,\lambda}$ of complex conjugation is -1. Moreover
$\rho_{f,\lambda}$ is potentially semi-stable at $\ell$ in the sense of Fontaine \cite{F-M}.

\vskip 3mm
We may choose a conjugate of $\rho_{f,\lambda}$ which is valued in
$GL(2,{\mathcal O}_{\bar{\BQ}_\lambda})$ and reducing modulo the maximal ideal and
semi-simplyfing yields an irreducible continuous representation
\begin{equation*}
{\overline \rho}_{f,\lambda}:G_\BQ\lrt GL(2,\overline{\mathbb F}_\ell)
\end{equation*}
which, up to isomorphism, does not depend on the choice of conjugate of $\rho_{f,\lambda}$.

\begin{definition}\label{def:1.1}
Let
$$\rho: G_\BQ\lrt GL(2,\bar{\BQ}_\ell)$$
be an irreducible continuous Galois representation which is unramified outside finitely
many primes and for which the restriction of $\rho$ to a decomposition group at $\ell$ is
potentially semi-stable at $\ell$ in the sense of Fontaine. Then $\rho$ is called
${\sf modular}$ if $\rho$ is equivalent to $\rho_{f,\lambda}$
(denoted $\rho\sim \rho_{f,\lambda}$) for some normalized eigenform $f$ and some place
$\lambda | \ell.$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{1.2}
Let
$${\overline\rho}: G_\BQ\lrt GL(2,\overline{\mathbb F}_\ell)$$
be a two-dimensional irreducible continuous representation of $G_\BQ$.
Then ${\overline\rho}$ is called
${\sf modular}$ if ${\overline\rho}\sim {\overline\rho}_{f,\lambda}$
for some normalized eigenform $f$ and some place $\lambda | \ell.$
\end{definition}

\vskip 3mm
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\BQ$. We define
\begin{equation*}
  a_p(E):=p+1-|E({\mathbb F}_p)| \quad {\rm for\ a\ prime}\ p.
\end{equation*}
The $L$-function $L(E,s)$ of $E$ is defined by the product of the local $L$-factors
\begin{equation*}
  L(E,s):=\prod_{p|D}\left( \frac{1}{1-a_p(E)p^{-s}}\right)
  \prod_{p\not| D}\left( \frac{1}{1-a_p(E)\,p^{-s}+p^{1-2s}}\right).
\end{equation*}
Then $L(E,s)$ converges absolutely for ${\rm Re}\,s> \frac{3}{2}$ and extends to
an entire function by \cite{BCDT}.
\begin{definition}\label{1.3}
An elliptic curve $E$ over $\BQ$ is called
${\sf modular}$ if there exists a Hecke eigenform $f\in S_2(N)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  L(E,s)=L(f,s).
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
Let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $\BQ$ with its conductor $N(E)$.
Let $$\rho_{E,\ell}:G_\BQ \lrt GL(2,\bar{\BQ}_\ell)$$
be the $\ell$-adic representation of $G_\BQ$ with the Tate module
$T_\ell (E)$ as its representation space. Let
\begin{equation*}
  J_1(N):=\Omega^1(X_1(N))^{\vee}/H_1(X_1(N),\BZ)\cong S_2(\G_1(N))^{\vee}/H_1(X_1(N),\BZ)
\end{equation*}
be the Jacobian variety of the modular curve $X_1(N)$. Here $\Omega^1(X_1(N))$
denotes the complex vector space of holomorphic 1-forms on $X_1(N)$ and $W^{\vee}$
denotes the dual space of a complex vector space $W$.
It is known that the following statements are equivalent\,:
\vskip 2mm
(a) $E$ is modular.
\vskip 2mm
(b) There is a non-constant holomorphic mapping $X_1(N)\lrt E(\BC)$ for some
positive \par
\ \ \ \ \ \ integer $N$.
\vskip 2mm
(c) There is a non-constant holomorphic mapping $J_1(N)\lrt E(\BC)$ for some positive \par
\ \ \ \ \ \,integer $N$.
\vskip 2mm
(d) $\rho_{E,\ell}$ is modular for a prime $\ell$.

\vskip 3mm
The above statements have been called the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture. We refer to
\cite{Sh3} for the historical story of this conjecture.
The implication (a)\,$\Longrightarrow$\,(b) follows from a construction of Shimura\,\cite{Sh2}
and a theorem of Faltings\,\cite{F}. The implication (b)\,$\Longrightarrow$\,(d) is due to
Mazur\,\cite{MA}. The implication (d)\,$\Longrightarrow$\,(a) follows from a theorem of
Carayol\,\cite{C}. The implication (c)\,$\Longrightarrow$\,(b) is obvious. Wiles\,\cite{TW,W}
proved that a semistable eliptic curve over $\BQ$ is modular by proving the statement (d).
Thereafter Breuil, Conrad, Diamond and Taylor\,\cite{BCDT} proved that every eliptic curve
over $\BQ$ is modular.

\vskip 3mm
Serre \cite{S} conjectured the following\,:
\vskip 2mm\noindent
{\bf Serre's\ Modularity\ Conjecture\,:} Let $\overline{\rho}:G_\BQ\lrt GL(2,{\mathbb F})$ be a two-dimensional
absolutely irreducible, continuous, odd representation of $G_\BQ$. Here $\mathbb F$ is a finite
field of characteristic $p$. Then $\overline{\rho}$ is modular, i.e., arises from (with respect to
some fixed embedding $\imath:\overline{\BQ}\hookrightarrow \overline{\BQ_p})$ a newform $f$ of
some weight $k\geq 2$ and level $N$ prime to $p$.

\vskip 3mm
In 2009, Khare and Wintenberger \cite{K-W1, K-W2} proved that Serre's Modularity Conjecture is true.

\begin{section}{{\bf The Modularity of an Abelian Variety}}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\vskip 2mm
Let $G:=Sp(2g,\BR)$ and $K=U(g).$
Let
$$\BH_g:=\{\,\Omega\in\BC^{(g,g)}\,|\ \Omega=\,{}^t\Omega,\ \,{\rm{Im}}\,\Omega>0\ \}$$
be the Siegel upper half plane of degree $g$.
Then $G$ acts on ${\mathbb H}_g$ transitively by

\begin{equation*}
  \alpha\cdot \Omega=(A\Omega+B)(C\Omega+D)^{-1},
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha=\begin{pmatrix}
           A & B \\
           C & D
         \end{pmatrix}\in G$ and $\Omega\in \BH_g.$
The stabilizer of the action (2.1) at $iI_g$ is

\begin{equation*}
  \left\{ \begin{pmatrix} \,A & B \\ -B & A \end{pmatrix} \Big| \ A+iB\in U(g)\,\right\}
  \cong U(g).
\end{equation*}
Thus we get the biholomorphic map
\begin{equation*}
G/K \lrt \BH_g, \qquad \alpha K \mapsto \alpha\!\cdot\! iI_g,  \quad \alpha\in G.
\end{equation*}
It is known that $\BH_g$ is an Einstein-K{\"a}hler Hermitian symmetric space.

\vskip 3mm
Let $\G_g:=Sp(2g,\BZ)$ be the Siegel modular group of degree $g$.
For a positive integer $N$, we let
\begin{equation*}
  \G_g(N):=\left\{ \g\in \G_g\,|\ \g\equiv I_{2g}\ ({\rm{mod}}\,N)\,\right\}
\end{equation*}
be the the principal congruence subgroup of $\G_g$ of level $N$. Let
\begin{equation*}
  \G_{g,0}(N):=\left\{ \g\in \G_g\,\big|\ \g=\begin{pmatrix}
                                       A & B \\
                                       C & D
                                     \end{pmatrix},\quad C\equiv 0\ ({\rm{mod}}\,N)\,\right\}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
  \G_{g,1}(N):=\left\{ \g\in \G_g\,\big| \
  \g=\begin{pmatrix}
      A & B \\
      C & D
     \end{pmatrix}\equiv \begin{pmatrix}
      I_g & * \\
      0 & I_g
     \end{pmatrix}\ ({\rm{mod}}\,N)\,\right\}
\end{equation*}
be the congruence subgroups of Level $N$. Then we have the relation
\begin{equation*}
  \G_g (N)\subset \G_{g,1} (N)\subset \G_{g,0} (N)\subset \G_g.
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}\label{def (2.1)}
Let $\G$ be a congruence subgroup of $\G_g$ and let $k$ be a nonnegative integer $k$.
A function $F:\BH_g\lrt \BC$ is called a
$\sf{Siegel\ modular\ form}$ of degree $g$ and weight $k$ with respect to $\G$
if it satisfies the following conditions\,:
\vskip 2mm
{\sf{(S1)}} $F(\Om)$ is holomorphic on $\BH_g$\,;
\vskip 2mm
{\sf{(S2)}} $F(\g\cdot \Om)=(C\Om+D)^k F(\Om)$ \ \ for all
$\g=\begin{pmatrix}
      A & B \\
      C & D
     \end{pmatrix}\in \G$ and $\Om\in \BH_g$\,;
\vskip 2mm
{\sf{(S3)}} $F(\Om)$ is bounded in any domain $Y\geq Y_0 > 0$ in the case $g=1$.
\end{definition}
We denote the space of all Sigel modular forms of degree $g$ and weight $k$
with respect to $\G$ by $[\G,k]$.
\vskip 2mm
We define the so-called $\sf{Siegel\ operator}$
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi_g: [\G_g,k]\lrt [\G_{g-1},k]
\end{equation*}
by
\begin{equation*}
  (\Phi_g(F))(\Om_1):=\lim_{t\lrt\infty}
  F  \begin{pmatrix}
      \Om_1 & 0 \\
      0 & i\,t
     \end{pmatrix},\quad \Om_1\in \BH_{g-1}.
\end{equation*}
Then $\Phi_g$ is a well-defined linear mapping (cf,\,\cite[pp.\,187--189]{M}).
A Siegel modular form $F\in [\G_g,k]$ is called a $\sf{Siegel\ cusp\ form}$ if
$\Phi_g(F)=0$\,(cf.\,\cite[p.\,198]{M}). We denote by $[\G_g,k]_0$
the space of all Siegel cusp forms in $[\G_g,k]$.

\vskip 3mm
Let $\G$ be a congruence subgroup of $\G_g$. If $F\in [\G,k]$, then $F$ has
a Fourier expansion
\begin{equation*}
  F(\Om)=\sum_{T} a(T;F)\,e^{2\pi i\,{\rm Tr}(T\Om)},
\end{equation*}
where $T$ runs through all $g\times g$ half-integral semi-positive symmetric matrices.
Here ${\rm Tr}(M)$ denotes the trace of a square matrix $M$.
Following the Hecke's method, Maass\,\cite[pp.\,202--210]{M} associated with
$F(\Om)$ the Dirichlet series
\begin{equation*}
D(F,s):=\sum_{\{ T \}}\frac{a(T;F)}{\varepsilon (T)}\,(\det T)^{-s},
\end{equation*}
where the summation indicates that $T$ runs through a complete set of representatives
of the sets
$$
\left\{ \, T[U]\,|\ U \ \rm{unimodular}\,\right\}, \ T>0
$$
and $\varepsilon (T)$ denotes the number of unimodular matrices $U$ which satisfy
the equation $T[U]=T.$ We note that the numbers $\varepsilon (T)$ are finite.

\begin{definition}\label{def:2.2}
Let $F$ be a nonzero Siegel Hecke eigenform in $[\G_g,k]_0$. Let
$\alpha_{p,0},\alpha_{p,1},\cdots,\alpha_{p,g}$ be the $p$-Satake parameters of $F$ at
a prime $p$. We define the $\sf{local\ spinor\ zeta\ function}$ $Z_{F,p}(t)$ of $F$ at $p$
by
$$
Z_{F,p}(t):=(1-\alpha_{p,0}\,t)\sum_{r=1}^g\sum_{1\leq i_1<\cdots < i_r\leq g}
(1-\alpha_{p,0}\alpha_{p,i_1}\cdots\alpha_{p,i_r}\,t).
$$
The $\sf{spinor\ zeta\ function}$ $Z_{F}(s)$ of $F$ is defined to be the following function
\begin{equation*}
Z_{F}(s):=\sum_{p:{\rm prime}} Z_{F,p}(p^{-s})^{-1},\quad {\rm Re}\,s \gg 0.
\end{equation*}
Secondly one has the so-called $\sf{standard\ zeta\ function}$ $D_{F}(s)$ of a Siegel Hecke
eigenform $F$ in $[\G_g,k]_0$ defined by

\begin{remark}\label{rk:2.3}
(1) If $g=1$, the spinor zeta function $Z_f(s)$ of a Hecke eigenform $f$ in $S_k(\G_1)$
is nothing but the Hecke $L$-function $L(f,s)$ of $f$.
\vskip 2mm\noindent
(2) If $g=1$, the standard zeta function $D_f(s)$ of a Hecke eigenform
$f(\tau)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a(n)\,e^{2\pi i n\tau}$ in $S_k(\G_1)$ has the following equation
$$
D_f(s-k+1)=\sum_{p:{\rm prime}}(1+p^{k-s-1})^{-1}\cdot\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a(n^2)\,n^{-s}.

Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional simple abelian variety defined over $\BQ$. For a prime $\ell$, we set
\begin{equation*}
  A[\ell^n]:=\{ \, x\in A(\overline{\BQ})\,|\ \ell^n\cdot x=0\,\}.
\end{equation*}
Then $A[\ell^n]\cong (\BZ/\ell^n \BZ)^g\times (\BZ/\ell^n \BZ)^g$\,(cf.\,\cite{MU}). Then the
Tate module of $A$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
  T_{\ell}(A):=\lim_{\longleftarrow} A[\ell^n]\cong \BZ_\ell^g\times \BZ_\ell^g
  \cong \BZ_{\ell}^{2g}.
\end{equation*}
Therefore we have the $2g$-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representation of $G_\BQ$
\begin{equation*}
\rho_{A,\ell}:G_\BQ\lrt GL(2g,\BZ_\ell)\subset GL(2g,\BQ_\ell).
\end{equation*}

\begin{definition}\label{def:2.4}
A $2g$-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representation $\rho$ of $G_\BQ$ given by
$$
\rho:G_\BQ\lrt GL(2g,\BZ_\ell)\subset GL(2g,\BQ_\ell)
$$
is called $\sf{modular}$ if there is a Siegel Hecke eigenform $F(\Om)\in [\G_{g,0}(N), g+1]_0$
of weight $g+1$ with respect to $\G_{g,0}(N)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  {\rm Tr}\left( \rho({\rm Frob}_p)\right)=a(pI_g;F)\quad {\rm and}\quad
  \det \left( \rho({\rm Frob}_p)\right)=p^g\quad {\rm for\ any\ prime}\ p\not|\, \ell N,
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
  F(\Om)=\sum_{T} a(T;F)\,e^{2\pi i\,{\rm Tr}(T\Om)}
\end{equation*}
is a Fourier expansion of $F(\Om)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:2.5}
Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional simple abelian variety defined over $\BQ$ and let $\ell$ be a prime.
 For a prime $p$, we let
\begin{equation*}
  L_p(A,s):=\left\{ \det\left( I_{2g}-p^{-s}\cdot
  \rho_{A,\ell}({\rm Frob}_p)\big|_{T_{\ell}(A)}\right)\right\}^{-1}
\end{equation*}
be the local $L$-function of $A$ at $p$. We define the $L$-function $L(A,s)$ of $A$ by
\begin{equation*}
  L(A,s)=\prod_{p:\,{\rm prime}}L_p(A,s).
\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{def:2.6}
Let $A$ be a $g$-dimensional simple abelian variety defined over $\BQ$.
$A$ is called $\sf{modular}$ if there exists a Siegel Hecke eigenform
$F(\Om)\in [\G_{g,0}(N), g+1]_0$
of weight $g+1$ with respect to $\G_{g,0}(N)$ such that
\begin{equation*}
  L(A,s)=D(F,s),\ Z_F(s)\ {\rm or}\ D_F(s).
\end{equation*}

For two positive integers $g$ and $N$, we let
\begin{equation*}
 {\mathcal A}_{g,0}(N):=\G_{g,0}(N)\ba \BH_g
\end{equation*}
be the Siegel modular variety of level structure $N$ and let
${\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)$ be a smooth toroidal compactification of
${\mathcal A}_{g,0}(N)$\,(cf.\,\cite{AMRT, F-C}). We denote by
\begin{equation*}
 \Omega^i \left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)\right), \quad 0\leq i\leq \frac{g(g+1)}{2}
\end{equation*}
the complex vector space of holomorphic $i$-forms on ${\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)$.
The Jacobian variety ${\rm Jac}\left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N) \right)$ of
${\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)$
is defined to be the abelian variety
\begin{equation}\label{(2.1)}
 {{\rm Jac}}({\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)):=\Omega^{\nu}
 \left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N) \right)^{\vee}
 / H_\nu \left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N),\BZ \right),\qquad \nu=\frac{g(g+1)}{2}.
\end{equation}
The geometric genus of ${\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)$ is the dimension of
the Jacobian variety ${\rm Jac}\left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N) \right)$.
It is known that the following two vector spaces are isomprphic\,:
\begin{equation}\label{(2.2)}
 [\G_{g,0}(N),g+1]_0\cong \Omega^{\nu}
 \left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N) \right),\qquad \nu=\frac{g(g+1)}{2}.
\end{equation}
More precisely, for a coordinate $\Omega=(\omega_{ij})\in \BH_g$, we let
\begin{equation*}
  \omega_0:=d\omega_{11}\wedge d\omega_{12}\wedge d\omega_{13}\wedge \cdots \wedge
  d\omega_{gg}
\end{equation*}
be a holomorphic $\nu$-form on $\BH_g$. If $\omega=F(\Om)\,\omega_0$ is a $\G_{g,0}(N)$-invariant
holomorphic form on $\BH_g$,
then
\begin{equation*}
F(\g\cdot \Om)=\det (C\Om+D)^{g+1}F(\Om)
\end{equation*}
for all $\g=\begin{pmatrix}
              A & B \\
              C & D
            \end{pmatrix}\in \G_{g,0}(N)$ and $\Om\in\BH_g.$ Thus
$F\in [\G_{g,0}(N),g+1].$ It was shown by Freitag\,\cite{Fr} that $\om$ can be extended
to a holomorphic $\nu$-form on ${\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)$ if and only if $F$ is
a cusp form in $[\G_{g,0}(N),g+1]_0.$ Indeed, the mapping
\begin{equation*}
[\G_{g,0}(N),g+1]_0 \lrt \Omega^{\nu}
 \left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N) \right),\qquad F\mapsto F\,\omega_0
\end{equation*}
is an isomorphism as complex vector spaces. We observe that if
$\om_k:=G(\Om)\, \om_0^{\otimes k}$ is a $\G_{g,0}(N)$-invariant
holomorphic form on $\BH_g$ of degree $k\nu$, then $G(\Om)\in [\G_{g,0}(N),k(g+1)]_0$
is a cusp form of weight $k(g+1).$
\vskip 3mm
Therefore according to \eqref{(2.1)} and \eqref{(2.2)}, we have
\begin{equation}\label{(2.3)}
{{\rm Jac}}({\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N))
 \cong [\G_{g,0}(N),g+1]_0^{\vee}
 / H_\nu \left( {\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N),\BZ \right),\qquad \nu=\frac{g(g+1)}{2}.
\end{equation}
If there is no confusion, we simply set
$$
J_{g,0}(N):= {{\rm Jac}}({\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)).
$$

We propose the following conjectures.

\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:2.7}
%{\bf Conjecture 2.1.}
A simple abelian variety of dimesion $g$ defined over $\BQ$ is modular.
\end{conjecture}

\noindent
\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:2.8}
%{\bf Conjecture 2.2.}
Let A be a simple abelian variety of dimesion $g$ defined over $\BQ$.
The following statements are equivalent\,:
\vskip 2mm
{\sf{(MAV1)}} $A$ is modular.
\vskip 1mm
{\sf{(MAV2)}} There exists a non-constant holomorphic mapping
${\mathcal A}_{g,0}^{\rm tor}(N)\lrt A$ for some
\par
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ positive integer $N$.
\vskip 1mm
{\sf{(MAV3)}} There exists a non-constant holomorphic mapping
$J_{g,0}(N)\lrt A$ for some
\par
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ positive integer $N$.
\vskip 1mm
{\sf{(MAV4)}} $\rho_{A,\ell}$ is modular for any prime $\ell$.
\end{conjecture}

\vskip 3mm
We propose the following problems.
\vskip 2mm \noindent
\begin{problem}\label{prob:2.9}
%{\bf Problem 2.1.}
Let $F\in [\G_{g,0}(N),g+1]_0$ be a Siegel Hecke eigenform of weight $g+1$.
Associate to $F$ a $2g$-dimensional continuous irreducible Galois representation
of $G_\BQ$.
\end{problem}

\vskip 2mm \noindent
\begin{problem}\label{prob:2.10}
%{\bf Problem 2.2.}
Let $k$ be a positive integer.
Let $F\in [\G_{g,0}(N),k]_0$ be a Siegel Hecke eigenform of weight $k$.
Associate to $F$ a $2g$-dimensional continuous irreducible Galois representation
of $G_\BQ$.
\end{problem}

\begin{remark}\label{rk:2.11}
As mentioned in Section 1, in the case $g=1$, to a Hecke eigenform of weight $k\geq 1$, Shimura, Deligne and Serre associated a two-dimensional continuous irreducible Galois representation. For the case
$g=2$, Taylor\,\cite{T1,T2} tried to associate the four dimensional continuous Galois representation
of $G_\BQ$ to a Siegel Hecke eigenform of small weight. But he did not specify the precise weight.
