## 🔄 **Session Handoff Information**

### For Next Session Resume
**What to do**: Continue with L1.1 implementation - start by setting up development environment and beginning TeX source analysis.

**Current Focus**: Beginning foundation layer implementation while learning Coq fundamentals in parallel.

**Key Context**: We're implementing the formal verification approach (not heuristic) as specified in `v22_formal_verification_specifications.md`. This is a revolutionary approach using mathematical proofs for zero false positives.

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. Set up Coq development environment
2. Download TeX Live source for grammar analysis  
3. Begin Software Foundations Chapter 1
4. Create initial project structure
