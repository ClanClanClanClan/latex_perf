# LaTeX Perfectionist Validation Challenge - Executive Summary

## The Challenge in One Sentence
Design an automated validation system that guarantees 100% accuracy for hundreds of LaTeX transformation rules without requiring manual review of thousands of documents.

## Why This is Hard

1. **100% Accuracy Required**: Unlike typical linters, we cannot tolerate ANY false positives
2. **Complex Context Detection**: Rules must respect LaTeX environments precisely (verbatim, math, comments, etc.)
3. **Scale**: One developer must validate hundreds of rules
4. **No Ground Truth**: Cannot manually review 10,000+ documents to create test data

## What We're Building

LaTeX Perfectionist: A tool that automatically fixes typography issues in LaTeX documents.

Example rule: Convert straight quotes to smart quotes
- Input: `He said "hello" to her.`
- Output: `He said "hello" to her.`
- BUT: Must NOT change quotes inside `\texttt{"code"}`, math mode, verbatim blocks, etc.

## Current Approach (Failing)

```python
# Position-based testing - error prone and doesn't test actual output
assert fix.start == 8
assert fix.end == 15
```

## Desired Approach

```python
# Behavior-based testing - simple and correct
assert apply_rule('He said "hello"') == 'He said "hello"'
assert apply_rule('\\texttt{"code"}') == '\\texttt{"code"}'  # No change!
```

## Core Technical Challenges

1. **Context Boundary Detection**: How to verify `\texttt{"quote"}` detection is exactly right?
2. **Test Coverage**: How to systematically cover all edge cases?
3. **Automation**: How to generate ground truth without manual work?
4. **Debugging**: When tests fail, how to quickly understand why?

## What Success Looks Like

- Run command: `validate_rule TYPO-001`
- Get result: `âœ… Passed: 100% precision on 10,000 test cases`
- If fails: Clear report showing exactly which cases failed and why
- Time to validate: Minutes, not days
- Manual effort: Zero

## Resources & Constraints

- Single developer (no team for manual review)
- Access to thousands of arXiv papers
- Python-based rule engine
- Must be deterministic and reproducible
- Must enable rapid iteration

## The Ask

Design a validation methodology that:
1. **Automatically** generates comprehensive test coverage
2. **Guarantees** 100% accuracy with mathematical certainty
3. **Scales** to hundreds of rules
4. **Requires** zero manual document review
5. **Enables** rapid debugging when issues found

We seek innovative solutions beyond traditional testing approaches.
